--- Common Attack Signatures ---

• User Behavior
• SQL Injection
• Cross-Site Scripting
• Command Injection
• Path Traversal and LFI


-- User Behavior Indicators --

• Multiple Failed Login Attempts
  → Incorrect usernames or passwords
  → Increase in failures from a single user account
  → Increase in failures from multiple user accounts
• Login Times
  → Time of day that logons or access requests are taking place
  → Abnormalities from a user’s baseline

-- SQL Injection --

• Inserting or injecting malicious SQL statements
• Manipulate expected database queries
  → Retrieve sensitive information
  → Extract hashed passwords
  → Bypass authentication logic
• Look for SQL keywords
  → SELECT, FROM, WHERE, UNION
• Look for injection characters
  → Single/double quotes, semicolons, comment indicators (dashes)
• URL-encoded keywords/injection characters
• Malformed entries or errors within database logs


-- Cross-Site Scripting --

• Executing malicious code by injecting JavaScript
  → Hijack user sessions
  → Steal cookies
  → Deface websites
• Look for <script> tag indicators
• Look for event handlers
  → onload, onclick, onmouseover
  → References to <script> tags
  → References to "javascript"
