-- Alert Triaging --

When alerts start flooding in, jumping straight into each one isn't efficient since not all alerts are equal. Some are noise, others are false positives, and a few may indicate real threats in progress

This is where alert triaging becomes critical. Triaging helps security teams identify which alerts deserve immediate attention, which can be deprioritised, and which can be safely ignored for a moment.

When multiple alerts appear, analysts should have a consistent method to assess and prioritise them quickly. 
There are many factors you can consider when triaging, but these are the fundamental ones that should always be part of your process of identifying and evaluating alerts:

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Key Factors          | Description                                                                 | Why It Matters?                                                        |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Severity Level       | Review the alert's severity rating, ranging from Informational to Critical. | Indicates the urgency of response and potential business risk.         |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Timestamp and        | Identify when the alert was triggered and check for related activity        | Helps identify ongoing attacks or patterns of repeated behaviour.      |
| Frequency            | before and after that time.                                                 |                                                                        |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Attack Stage         | Determine which stage of the attack lifecycle this alert indicates          | It gives insight into how far the attacker may have progressed and     |
|                      | (reconnaissance, persistence, or data exfiltration).                        | their objective.                                                       |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Affected Asset       | Identify the system, user, or resource involved and assess its              | Prioritises response based on the asset's importance and the potential |
|                      | importance to operations.                                                   | impact of compromise.                                                  |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In short, these four represent the essential dimensions of triage:

• Severity: How bad?
• Time: When?
• Context: Where in the attack lifecycle?
• Impact: Who or what is affected?

They form a balanced foundation that's simple enough for analysts to apply quickly but comprehensive enough for informed decisions.

After reviewing these factors, decide on your next step: escalate to the incident response team, perform a deeper investigation, or close the alert if it's confirmed to be a false positive. 
A structured triage process like this helps ensure that time and resources are focused on what truly matters.


-- Diving Deeper into an Alert --

After identifying which alerts deserve further attention, it's time to dig into the details. Follow these steps to investigate and correlate effectively:

• Investigate the alert in detail: Open the alert and review the entities, event data, and detection logic. Confirm whether the activity represents real malicious behaviour.
• Check the related logs: Examine the relevant log sources. Look for patterns or unusual actions that align with the alert.
• Correlate multiple alerts: Identify other alerts involving the same user, IP address, or device. Correlation often reveals a broader attack sequence or coordinated activity.
• Build context and a timeline: Combine timestamps, user actions, and affected assets to reconstruct the sequence of events. This helps determine if the attack is ongoing or has already been contained.
• Decide on the following action: If there are indicators of compromise, escalate to the incident response team. Investigate further if more evidence or correlation is needed. Close or suppress if the alert is a confirmed false positive, and update detection rules accordingly.
• Document findings and lessons learned: Keep a clear record of the analysis, decisions, and remediation steps. Proper documentation strengthens SOC processes and supports continuous improvement.
