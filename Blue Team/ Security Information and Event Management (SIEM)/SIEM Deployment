🔧 SIEM Components

Endpoint (Data) → Forwarder → Indexer → Search Head → Analyst

Endpoint (Data): Devices or systems generating logs (servers, workstations, firewalls).
Forwarder: Collects logs from endpoints and sends them to the indexer.
Indexer: Stores and processes logs for fast search and retrieval.
Search Head: Allows users to query and analyze data across multiple indexers.
Analyst: Uses dashboards and alerts to investigate incidents and security trends.


🚚 Heavy Forwarder vs Universal Forwarder

Heavy Forwarder: Parses and filters data before forwarding; uses more system resources.
Universal Forwarder: Lightweight agent that only forwards raw data with minimal processing.


🏗 SIEM Deployment Models

Single Instance: All components (indexing, searching, UI) are combined on one server.
Distributed Deployment: Components are split across multiple servers for scalability and performance.
Clustered Deployment: Multiple redundant instances (indexers/search heads) for high availability.
