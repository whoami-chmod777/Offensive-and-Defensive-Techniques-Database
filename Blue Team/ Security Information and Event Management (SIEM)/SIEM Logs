📁 Common Log File Paths

🪟 Windows
• Event Logs → C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\
• Sysmon Logs → View via Event Viewer → Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon
• IIS Logs (Web) → C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\
• Firewall Logs → C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log (if enabled)
• Application Logs → Varies, often inside C:\ProgramData\ or app-specific folders
• PowerShell Logs → Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell

💡 Use Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) to access and filter most Windows logs.


🐧 Linux
• Syslog (Debian) → /var/log/syslog
• Messages (RHEL) → /var/log/messages
• Auth Logs → /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure (RHEL)
• Cron Jobs → /var/log/cron or included in /var/log/syslog
• Boot Logs → /var/log/boot.log
• Kernel Logs → /var/log/kern.log
• App Logs → Usually in /var/log/<app-name>/
• Web Server Logs → Apache: /var/log/apache2/ or /var/log/httpd/
• Web Server Logs → NGINX: /var/log/nginx/

💡 Use journalctl for viewing logs from systemd-enabled systems.


-- Log Formats --

🔹 Unstructured Logs
  → No predefined format or syntax
  → Common Log Format (CLF)

🔹 Semi-Structured Logs
  → Some syntax structure
  → Lack adherence to a schema
  → Syslog
  → Windows Event Log (EVT)

🔹 Structured Logs
  → Well-defined syntax and formatting
  → Adherence to an agreed upon schema
  → CSV, TSV
  → JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
  → eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
