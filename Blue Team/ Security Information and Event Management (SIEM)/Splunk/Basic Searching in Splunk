-- Wildcards --

Use wildcards (*) to match characters in string values for events in your index:
✓ As best practice, use wildcards at the end of a term, e.g., pass*, fail*
✓ Avoid using wildcards in the following situations:
  ○ Beginning of a string – *fail, *word
    ➤ Search will look at EVERY string, i.e., scans all events.
    ➤ Can cause performance issues.
  ○ Middle of a string – http*buttercupgames.com
    ➤ Might cause inconsistent results especially in strings containing punctuation.

Search events that match the following terms with wildcards for all time. Compare execution times.

• fail*
• pass*
• http://www.buttercupgames.com


-- Boolean Operators --

Use Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT to combine search terms:
  ✓ Boolean Operators must be in uppercase.
  ✓ The AND operator is implied between terms. Does not need to be explicitly specified.
     ○ Search for failed password is the same as failed AND password.
  ✓ NOT operator applies to the term immediately following NOT.
     ○ user NOT administrator – Search events that contain the word user and does not contain the word administrator.

Search events that match the following terms with Boolean operators for all time
• failed password same as failed AND password
• invalid OR Macintosh
• (www1 OR www2) user amanda same as (www1 OR www2) AND user AND amanda
• user administrator
• user NOT administrator


-- Search Assistant --
