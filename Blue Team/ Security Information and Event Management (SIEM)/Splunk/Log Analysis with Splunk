-- Initial Triage --

index=main sourcetype=web_traffic


Let's break down our result for a better understanding:

    Search query: This query retrieves all events from the main index that were tagged with the custom source type web_traffic. This marks the beginning of the investigation.
    Time range: The time range is currently set to "All time". In security analysis, this range would be tightened (e.g., to the spike window) after initial data loading.
    Timeline: This visual histogram shows the distribution of the 17,172 events over time. The graph indicates the successful daily log volume followed by a distinctive traffic spike (a period of high activity, likely the attack window).
    Selected fields: These are the fields currently chosen to be displayed in the summary column of the event list (host, source, sourcetype). They represent basic metadata about the log file itself.
    Interesting fields: This pane lists all fields that Splunk has automatically extracted or manually added. Fields prefixed with # (e.g., #date_hour) are automatically generated by Splunk's time commands. The presence of user_agent, path, and client_ip confirms the successful parsing of the web log structure.
    Event details & field extraction: This section shows the parsed details of a single event with extracted fields like user_agent, path, status, client_ip, and more.
