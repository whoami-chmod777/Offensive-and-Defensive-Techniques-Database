-- Search Language Components, Syntax and Pipeline --

• Apply Search Terms to retrieve data from the index(s).
  ✓ Keywords, phrases, wildcards, Booleans, etc.

• Apply commands to events retrieved by Search Terms:
  ✓ Commands
    ○ Specifies what to do with results retrieved.
    ○ Calculate statistics, generate charts, evaluate new fields, etc.
  ✓ Functions
    ○ Defines how to perform a task required by the command.
    ○ Function Arguments provide the variables needed for the function to work.
  ✓ Arguments
    ○ Variables needed for the command to work.
    ○ Example: Command argument can limit the number of results.
  ✓ Clauses
    ○ Group or rename fields in your results.

• A series of commands can be applied to data retrieved from the index:
  ✓ Commands separated by pipe (|) character.
  ✓ Next command applied to intermediate results by previous command.
  ✓ This is known as the Search Pipeline.


-- Search Pipeline Readability --

• Change the search bar theme – Preferences → SPL Editor → Themes:
  ✓ Light Theme
    ○ Default theme.
    ○ Provides syntax coloring on white background.
  ✓ Dark Theme
    ○ Provides syntax coloring on dark background.
  ✓ Black on White
    ○ Disables syntax coloring.
    ○ Uses back font in white background.

• Activate Search Auto-Format:
  ✓ When enabled, each pipe character appears on a separate line.
  ✓ This improves readability.

• Add Line Numbers:
  ✓ Line numbers will show next to each line in the search pipeline.

index=main sourcetype=eventgen (nodeName=host01 OR nodeName=host02) NOT partner=Telco07
| eval callResult=if(responseCode==200, "Success", "Failure")
| top limit=0 callResult
| rename callResult AS finalResult

• Commands are in Blue:
✓ eval
✓ top
✓ rename

• Functions are in Purple:
✓ if
✓ count

• Boolean Operators and Clauses (command modifiers) are in Orange:
✓ AND, OR, NOT
✓ BY, AS

• Command arguments are in Green:
✓ limit
✓ span

• Run the query “index=main sourcetype=eventgen (nodeName=host01 OR nodeName=host02) NOT partner=Telco07” for last 60 mins.
  ✓ Change the search bar theme from default to light, Dark, Black on While and check the behavior.
  ✓ Activate search auto-format and then add | eval to the search. Notice that the pipe (|) moves to the next line.
  ✓ Activate line numbers and remove and add | eval again. Notice pipe(|) moves to next line but a line number is also added.
  ✓ Complete the search as below and verify the syntax coloring:
   
index=main sourcetype=eventgen (nodeName=host01 OR nodeName=host02) NOT partner=Telco07
| eval CallResult=if(responseCode==200, "Success", "Failure")
| top limit=0 CallResult
| rename CallResult AS finalResult


-- fields Command --

• Use the fields command to filter list of fields returned in search results.
• Note that internal fields _raw and _time (timestamp) are returned by default.
  ✓ To include fields:
    ○ Use fields (or fields +) – default behavior.
    ○ Only the specified fields are extracted.
    ○ Performance improvement on field extractions.
  ✓ To exclude fields:
    ○ Use fields -
    ○ Happens after field extractions – no performance improvement.

• From web index and sourcetype access_combined:
  ✓ Return only fields action, clientip, categoryId, JSESSIONID for all time.
  ✓ Use the job inspector the check duration of the search query.
  ✓ Run same search without the fields command. Check the duration and compare with the previous search.
• From web index and sourcetype access_combined:
  ✓ Remove fields action, clientip, categoryId, JSESSIONID for all time.


-- table and rename Commands --

• The table command creates a statistics table of the specified fields.
• Each row of the table represents an event, and the columns represent field names.
• Columns are displayed in the order given in the command.
• Use the rename command to change the name of a field.
• Useful when you want to provide meaningful names.
• Use double-quotes when field names include spaces or special characters.

• From web index and sourcetype access_combined:
  ✓ Return a stats table of clientip, bytes, status, method, productId fields.
  ✓ Examine the table and order of field names.
  ✓ Rename the fields in the table:
    o Method to “HTTP Method”, status “HTTP Status”, clientip to Client_IPAddress
