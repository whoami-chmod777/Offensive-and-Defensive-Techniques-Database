--- Splunk - The Basics ---

Splunk is one of the leading SIEM solutions in the market. It allows users to collect, analyze, and correlate network and machine logs in real time. 
Iwill explore the basics of Splunk and its functionalities, and how it provides better visibility of network activities and helps speed up detection.

-- Splunk Components --

Splunk has three main components: Forwarder, Indexer, and Search Head. These components work together to help us search and analyze the data. 

➜ Splunk Forwarder

Splunk Forwarder is a lightweight agent installed on the endpoint intended to be monitored, and its main task is to collect the data and send it to the Splunk instance. It does not affect the endpoint's performance as it takes a few resources to process. Some of the key data sources are:

• Web server generating web traffic.
• Windows machine generating Windows Event Logs, PowerShell, and Sysmon data.
• Linux host generating host-centric logs.
• Database generating DB connection requests, responses, and errors.

The forwarder collects the data from the log sources and sends it to the Splunk Indexer. 

➜ Splunk Indexer

Splunk Indexer plays the main role in processing the data it receives from forwarders. It parses and normalizes the data into field-value pairs, categorizes it, and stores the results as events, making the processed data easy to search and analyze.
Now, the data, which is normalized and stored by the indexer, can be searched by the Search Head, as explained below.

➜ Search Head

Splunk Search Head is the place within the Search & Reporting App where users can search the indexed logs, as shown below. 
The searches are done using the SPL (Search Processing Language), a powerful query language for searching indexed data. 
When the user performs a search, the request is sent to the indexer, and the relevant events are returned as field-value pairs.
The Search Head also allows you to transform results into presentable tables and visualizations such as pie, bar, and column charts, as shown below:


-- Navigating Splunk --

When you access Splunk, you will see the default home screen.

Let's look at each section of this home screen. 

➜ Splunk Bar

The top panel is the Splunk Bar. In the Splunk Bar, we have the following options available:

• Messages: View system-level notifications and messages.
• Settings: Configure Splunk instance settings.
• Activity: Review the progress of search jobs and processes.
• Help: View tutorials and documentation.
• Find: Search across the App.

The Splunk Bar, allows users to switch between installed Splunk apps instead of using the Apps panel.

➜ Apps Panel  

Next is the Apps Panel. This panel shows the apps installed for the Splunk instance. The default app for every Splunk installation is Search & Reporting. 
You can also switch between the Splunk Apps directly from the Splunk Bar, as shown below, without using the Apps Panel.

➜ Explore Splunk 

The next section is Explore Splunk . This panel contains quick links to add data to the Splunk instance, add new Splunk apps, and access the Splunk documentation. 

➜ Splunk Dashboard

The last section is the Home Dashboard. By default, no dashboards are displayed. You can choose from a range of dashboards readily available within your Splunk instance. 
You can select a dashboard from the dropdown menu or by visiting the dashboards listing page.

You can also create dashboards and add them to the Home Dashboard. The dashboards you create can be viewed separately from the other dashboards by clicking on the Yours tab.
