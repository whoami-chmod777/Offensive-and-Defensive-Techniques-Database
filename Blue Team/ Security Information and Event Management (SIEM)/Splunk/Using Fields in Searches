-- What are Fields --

• Fields are searchable name/value pairs in your event data.
• Searches using fields are more efficient than searches using keywords or quoted phrases.
• Fields can be extracted from data at index time and at search time.
  ✓ Index-time Extractions:
    ○ Metadata fields: host, source, sourcetype, index.
    ○ Internal fields: _time, _raw, etc.
    ○ Custom fields.
  ✓ Search-time Extractions:
    ○ Field Discovery
      ➤ Automatically discover fields based on sourcetype and name/value pairs in your data.
      ➤ Enabled by default.
    ○ Custom Fields.
    ○ Ad-hoc Search.

• Most data vendors have documentation for field name/value mappings that can be used to define extractions in Splunk.

• Run the query index=web sourcetype=access_combined for All time.
• Identify metadata fields host, source, sourcetype, index and internal fields _time, _raw.
• Change search mode to Fast to disable field discovery. Revert to re-enable field discovery.
• Identify data-specific fields for clientip, categoryId, status.

index=main sourcetype=eventgen nodeName=host05
index=main sourcetype=eventgen partner=Telco04 calleeNumber=5500*
index=main sourcetype=eventgen (nodeName=host05 OR nodeName=host07) responseCode>200 deviceMAC="*33:9f:dl:ed:66:20*"

index=web sourcetype=access_combined
