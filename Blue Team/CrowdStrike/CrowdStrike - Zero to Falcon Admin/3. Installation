-- Manual vs Automatic Installs --

Should be able to complete sensor roll out to all hosts within 45 days.
Do not shutdown or reboot the host while the sensor is installing.

1. Manual install
a. Small number to deploy
i. Host setup and management > sensor downloads > installer based on OS > download > copy CID
ii. Doubleclick the pkg file > CID > go through installation
iii. Verify sensor is running: sc.exe query csagent

2. Automatic install
i. SCCM or automated push
ii. Host setup > sensor downloads > sensor installer based on OS > download > copy CID
iii. Run on CLI via your deployment tool

<installer file name> /install /quiet /norestart CID=<CID>


-- Points of Note --

Make sure you have the correct installer for version OS. Sensor Release Matrix in knowledge base article
*FQDN domains need to be on allowed list = Documentation Cloud IP addresses
Need to be allowed in network for those, see docs for IPs and domains for data between sensors and cloud


-- Networking Items --

Installer makes several attempts to connect to the cloud. If failure, it will uninstall

Network Dependencies: outbound SSL traffic (port 443)
Sensor uses certificate pinning: add falcon domain and IPs to bypass any firewall/proxy deep packet inspection, pinning = what certs are valid, certs get pinned CA public keys to check against

Specific URLs and IPs will differ based on what cloud instance you are on (US1, US2, GOV, etc)


-- Windows Installation --

Requirements:
• LM hosts (might be disabled)
• Network store interface
• Windows base filtering engine
• Windows power services
• WinHTTP auto proxy (if using a proxy)

In order to use the NGAV that comes with CS, Windows Defender must be disabled

Cant change the installation path

HOW TO: GUI or CLI, both need company code (CID)

<installer file name> /install /quiet /norestart CID=<string of numbers>

/quiet = no UI prompt  /norestart = ensures the host doesn’t reboot after install

Verify sensor: sc.exe query csagent


-- Linux Install --

CLI Install option only, no GUI available.
*Make sure you check what OSs are supported

uname -r to get kernel version (to make sure the version is supported)

Ubuntu: sudo dpkg -I <installer package>
RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux: sudo yum install <installer package>
SLES: sudo zypper install <installer package>

Register it with: sudo /opt/crowdstrike/falconctl -s --cid=<CID>
Start the sensor: systemctl start falcon-sensor
Check if running: ps -e | grep falcon-sensor


-- MacOS Install --

Elevated privileges needed
JAMF to script out and install, always more customization on the CLI compared to GUI

Grab the right sensor pkg file, double click and roll or go to CLI
1. Install file on host
2. License the sensor with CID

To Install: sudo installer -verboseR -package <installer filename> -target /
Register the sensor: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license <CID>

Kernel extensions (KEX) will need to be approved

Check stats: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats


-- Installation Tokens --

Host setup > installation tokens:
• 1 year, 90 days, 30 days, does not expire
• Can align best to your org, maybe 30 days is best
• Can stagger all 50 that are available to you

Prevent unauthorized installations
• Opt-in: it is off by default
• Set expiration to rotate tokens
• 50 tokens per CID

Create in falcon console or through API
Keep them secret, for preventing anyone from installing the sensors

Audit log will show who has taken tokens on the console

Usage: 
--provisioning-token <token> 
ProvToken = <token>
