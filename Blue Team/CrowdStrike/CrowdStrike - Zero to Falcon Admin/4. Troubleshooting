• The Checklist
• RFM


-- The Checklist --

• Is the OS supported by CS?
• System requirements met for what services need to be running?
• KEX approved for Macs?
• Did you verify that the sensor is running?
• Network requirements met for the correct enabled/allowed lists at the Firewalls?
• Did you use the correct installer with correct command line and correct CID?
• Netstat.exe -f with admin creds to see if the falcon domain name or falcon cloud IPs is showing an established connection
• If cant connect to the cloud: can your host get on the internet? Are you using a proxy and are those settings correct? Firewall/network settings correct? Check that the host trusts the CS CA?
• Are there other products interfering with the falcon sensor? (avast, bitdefender, AVG, ZoneAlarm, etc)
• Is it a timeout issue? Agent install will timeout after 20min. Can override with the ProvNoWait parameter in the command line: <installer_filename> /install /quiet /norestart CID=<CID> ProvNoWait=1
• What do the logs say? Any error codes present? (%LOCALAPPDATA%\temp) for anything matching crowdstrike around time of installation


-- RFM --

Reduced Functionality Mode
• The sensor enters safe mode, limited logging if any based on the OS affected
• Unsupported Kernel updates
• Use the sensor dashboards available to check what sensors have entered RFM

Options to address:
• Roll back the system updates or downgrade to an older version of that system
• Bear and grit it until Falcon releases a sensor update for that kernel
