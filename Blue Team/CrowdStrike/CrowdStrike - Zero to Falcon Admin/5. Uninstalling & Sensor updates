--- Uninstalling & Sensor Updates ---

• Steps for Uninstall
• Uninstall and Maintenance Protection
• Sensor Updating
• Update Throttling


-- Steps for Uninstall --

1. Control panel > programs and features > uninstall
2. Download a CS uninstall tool from "Tool Downloads" in console
  a. CSUninstall tool
  b. HKLM\system\crowdstrike should be gone

Find the host in host management, reveal maintenance token and copy 

Support > tool download > sensor removal tool based on OS > download it

Uninstall via CLI:

csuninstalltool.exe MAINTENANCE_TOKEN=<token> /quiet
CsUninstallTool.exe /quiet

MacOS: sudo /library/cs/falconctl uninstall --maintenance-token (for 1 host)

Linux:

• Ubuntu: sudo apt-get purge falcon-sensor
• RHEL, centOS, amazon: sudo yum remove falcon-sensor
• SLES: sudo zypper remove falcon-sensor

3. Use “PUT” file of CSuninstall tool from "tool downloads" onto CS files
  → Put the file on the host
  → Then run "C:\CsUninstallTool.exe" or csuninstalltool.exe MAINTENANCE_TOKEN=token /quiet
  → Validate the sensor uninstall by navigating to: HKLM\system\crowdstrike and C:\Windows\system32\drivers\CrowdStrike

(Blue note on the right: Use a policy to do so with sensor uninstallation and maintenance policy disabled and sensor version upgrades.)


-- Uninstall and Maintenance Protection --

Can’t uninstall without a token if maintenance protections is enabled

Bulk maintenance mode:
• Not recommended globally, one token to rule them all
• Sensor update has to be off
• Use targeted host groups which require manual updates

Bulk Uninstall:
• 1 token for all hosts in that policy or with the bulk maintenance mode enabled


-- Sensor Updating --

Should be in a policy

Host setup and management > sensor update policies > create new > name it > create

Set the settings:
• uninstall and maintenance protection: on
• sensor version: Auto-latest or N-1 or whichever you want to set

Auto-latest = test pilot machines to see how the latest sensor goes N-1 or N-2 for best practice

Sensor version Updates off = manual management of the updated sensor versions


-- Update Throttling --

• Limits number of hosts performing updates at once
• Think about the network resources it takes to update 5,000 endpoints all at the same time...

Set the number of hosts per minute that you want to have updated in Support and Resources > General Settings

Best Practice:
• TEST groups!
• N-1
• N-2 for the paranoid
• Go slow
