• The Big Picture
• What makes up Prevention Policies
• Prevention Policy Precedence
• Default, Phase 1,2,3 Prevention Policies


-- The Big Picture --

• Hosts are placed into host groups
• Make the policies that you want for the host group
• Those policies make up the Prevention Policy
• Assign a Prevention Policy to a host group


-- What makes up Prevention Policies --

1. Sensor visibilities
2. NGAV (can slide the detection vs prevention settings from cautious -> extra aggressive)
3. Malware protection
4. Behavior and ML detections


-- Prevention Policy Precedence --

• Hosts may be assigned to more than one policy
• If no host assigned to a policy, it will drop to the last precedence policy = default
• Default = catch all policy

Make one: endpoint security > prevention policies > create new > platform > name > create > enable settings > save > confirm > enable > enable policy

set the precedence order


-- Default, Phase 1,2,3 Prevention Policies --

Phase 1: Intended for customers setting up Falcon for the first time
• Rapid deployment strategy, doesn’t fully protect, should be used during initial deployment and alongside an AV
• Should use for a minimum time

Phase 2: Intended if you have no AV or EDR solution currently in place
• A bit more protective in policy settings
• Should use for 30 days
• Start introducing your IOA

Phase 3: The ideal standard level of protection for your hosts
• Should try to get here in 90 days or less to ensure adequate protection of your endpoints
