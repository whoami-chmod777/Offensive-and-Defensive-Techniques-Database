-- What are IOAs? --

• Indicators of Attack (IOA)
• Custom IOCs to implement into CS via regex pattern matching
• Actions: Monitor, Detect, Block Execution, Kill Process (depends on what Rule Type you select)
• Rule Types: Process Creation, File Creation, Network Connection, Domain Name

Path: Endpoint security > Configure > Custom IOA Rule Groups


-- IOA Workflow --

• Create a rule group
• Add your IOAs to the rule group
• Enable your rules
• Enable your IOA rule group
• Assign Group to a Prevention Policy


-- Different options based on OS --

Rule Types: Process Creation, File Creation, Network Connection, Domain Name

| Rule Option        | Windows  | MacOS | Linux |
|--------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Process Creation   |    ✔    |   ✔   |   ✔   |
| File Creation      |    ✔    |   ✔   |   ✔   |
| Network Connection |    ✔    |   ✔   |       |
| Domain Name        |    ✔    |       |        |
|--------------------|----------|-------|-------|


-- Review of Regex and CS Gotchas --

1. .* still works for wildcards
2. Need to escape \ just like usual
3. Leave all unused fields as .*
4. Always TEST the rule before implementing. Just because test pattern is correct doesn’t mean it’s the right regex for the job!

What we can do with IOAs:

1. Block CIDR ranges of IPs
2. Blocking IPs
3. Blocking Domains
4. File names
5. File paths
6. Parent, Grandparent file names
7. Command Line Arguments, parent command lines


-- IOC Management --

• Keep in mind, these are all sensor-based actions
• Can assign a severity to the detection (color codes can be set in preferences)
• Can put to a specific host group, or all hosts
• Can add tags into the IOC being implemented (“Bad IP”, “Adware”, “IT Tool”)

| Type    | Block | Block+Hide | Allow | Detect Only | Do Nothing |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Domains |       |            |       |      ✔     |     ✔      |
| Hashes  |   ✔   |     ✔     |   ✔   |      ✔     |     ✔      |
| IPs     |       |            |       |      ✔     |     ✔      |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|-------------|------------|
