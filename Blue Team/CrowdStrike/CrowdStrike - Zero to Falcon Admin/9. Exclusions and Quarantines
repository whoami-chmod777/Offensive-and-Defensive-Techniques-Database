-- What is an Exclusion --

How to tune your console
These are whitelisted, trusted processes, that you want to exclude from detections
Could be another AV or EDR solution to add exclusions for

3 Types:

1. Machine Learning = manual or via detection page to create (GLOB syntax)
• File paths

2. IOAs = configured via the detection page only (regex)
• behavioral exclusions that come up for FP CS detections

3. Sensor Visibility = completely ignored by the falcon sensor. Use with caution, or don’t use it at all.
• last resort option
• sensor wont really log the events, either

Exclusions will apply to ALL hosts or to specific Hosts Groups you select


-- GLOB Patterns --

Uses matches found in detections to create the exclusion
Assumes drive letters, so you don’t need to add them
Limit of 1 pattern per exclusion
\*\ For one folder
\** For recursive

How to add a ML Exclusion: In filter bar: triggering file: <filename> and then group by hash, group by command line, etc and then copy it

Go to: endpoint sec > exclusions > ML exclusions > all hosts > next > paste in command line in exclusion pattern, click detections and preventions check box > create
** always test the pattern

Example for Malwarebytes:

*\Program Data\Malwarebytes*  
*\Program Files\Malwarebytes*  


-- Quarantined Files --

Need to enable it in the prevention policy
Not available on the Linux platform, but should be soon
Locally stored malware files will be stored on the host for 30 days, then deleted

Windows: \Windows\system32\Drives\CrowdStrike\Quarantine
MacOS: /Library/Application Support/CrowdStrike/Falcon/Quarantine

When Downloading/Uploading a Quarantined File:
• Pw is infected, for a stop and pause moment to take note
• 32MB is max size to upload to the cloud - windows and mac only
• Local quarantine on a host = 30 days
• Cloud storage = 90 days (90 days together max, not 120 days)
