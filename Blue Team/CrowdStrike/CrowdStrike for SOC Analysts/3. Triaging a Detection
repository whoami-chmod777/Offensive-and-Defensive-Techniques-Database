--- Triaging a Detection ---

• Detections
• Icons & Color Coding
• Where to look first
• Group your Detections, if it helps
• Things to ask yourself when looking at a Detection
• What to include in a write up


-- Detections --

Detections are present for a 90 day retention period
Indicators are present based on your CS retention period, more than likely this is 1 year


-- Icons & Color Coding --

• If there is a white badge = a process was killed or an operation was blocked
• Multiple detections, could be part of an Incident
• If there is a green badge = a process was blocked

Right side legend:
• Malware - Informational
• Overwatch Detection
• Persistence, Defense Evasion, blocked/killed
• Malware - High


-- Where to look first --

• Detect Time: Jul. 29, 2023 10:29:56
• Hostname: Christinas-MacBook-Air.local
• Host Type: Workstation
• User Name: christinalaurencarter
• Severity: Medium
• Objective: Falcon Detection Method
• Tactic & Technique: Falcon Intel via Intelligence Indicator - Domain
• Technique ID: CST0018
• IOA Name: IntelDomainMedium
• IOA Description: A domain lookup matched a CrowdStrike Intelligence indicator


-- Group your Detections, if it helps --

• Options: No grouping, Grouped by Host, Grouped by Grouping Tags, Grouped by Objective, Grouped by Tactic, Grouped by Technique, Grouped by Technique ID, Grouped by IOA Name
• Sort by newest detect time


-- Things to ask yourself when looking at a Detection --

Are we dealing with a Server or a Workstation?
What is the severity of the alert?
What is CS noting for MITRE Tactic & Technique?
Was anything blocked?
Is something still running?
Any flags for indicators or known TA groups?
Do we recognize the file name or other processes involved?
Outbound active network connections seen?
Suspicious command line arguments?
Odd parent child process trees?
Hash, IP, Domain, URL analysis from OSINT?


-- What to include in a write up --

• At a minimum: Host, timestamps (UTC), process involved, command lines, what happened on the host, what actions you took, OSINT research
• Nice to have: Root Cause Analysis, pictures of forensic artifacts you found, scoping steps taken, next steps/recommendations to the next tier in the SOC, sandbox sample/analysis, link to the detection

Tip:
Best to develop your own “detection template” that you can use to just fill in each time you do a write up.
