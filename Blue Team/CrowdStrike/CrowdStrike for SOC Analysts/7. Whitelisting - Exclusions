• 3 Types of Exclusions in CS
• Example: ML based Exclusion
• Example: IOA Based Exclusion
• Sensor Visibility Exclusions
• Some Side Notes
• Falcon Prevent Policies
• Falcon Prevent Console Settings


-- 3 Types of Exclusions in CS --

Types visible in console:

• Machine Learning Exclusions
  → IOA Exclusions
  → Sensor Visibility Exclusions
• Machine Learning and IOA: Made that option from a detection
• Sensor Visibility: Complete exclusion from the sensor, won’t even collect logs, everything in the path you specify will be allowed to run. You manually put in the path to whitelist here.


-- Example: ML based Exclusion --

• Comes from CS machine learning repository of known malware, hashes, files, etc.
• Example IOA Name: Machine Learning Identified High Confidence Malicious File
• Description: 
  A file written to the file system meets the on-sensor machine learning high confidence threshold for malicious files. Detection is based on entropy, packing, anti-malware evasion, or similarity to known malware.


-- Example: IOA Based Exclusion --

• Detection comes from an IOA
• Example IOA Name: SuspiciousFileWritten
• Description:
  A process has written a suspicious file to disk. Adversaries may write a malicious file to a commonly trusted directory, use a benign name, or mismatch file extension.


-- Sensor Visibility Exclusions --

• Complete visibility loss
• Use Glob pattern syntax:
  → Example: C:\Program Files\McAfee\
  → Program Files\McAfee\**
  → **\McAfee.exe


-- Some Side Notes --

• Can always whitelist (WL) a hash in IOC Management
• Can always allow an IP from HBFW
• OverWatch detections cannot be excluded
• Can’t allow or WL from Custom IOAs


-- Falcon Prevent Policies --

• Default policies shown for different OS and environments
• Prevention controls can vary depending on assigned policy


-- Falcon Prevent Console Settings --

• Security configuration options include enforcement levels and detection settings.
• Admins can tune policies here.
