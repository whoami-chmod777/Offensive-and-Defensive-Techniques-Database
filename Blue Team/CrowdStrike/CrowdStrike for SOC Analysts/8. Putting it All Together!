-- Create your Detection Template --

• Always best to have a clean, formal, professional alert template:
  → Highlight important information at the top
  → Always report in UTC
  → Use your own words for summarizing at the top of the report
• Use it as a repeatable process to follow
  → This lowers triage time as you gain experience
• Doesn’t have to be fancy → even Notepad++ works fine
• (Note: Slide mentions a downloadable template for customization.)
