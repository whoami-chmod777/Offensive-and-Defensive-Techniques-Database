-- Content categories --

CrowdStrike-initiated content updates are grouped into content categories, giving you more granular control over how they are deployed to your hosts and how you reference release notes and set up notifications.
A content package updates release version can include content updates from one or more of these categories.

• System Critical
• Sensor Operations
• Rapid Response
• Vulnerability Management

Note: Vulnerability Management content updates are only available with the Falcon Exposure Management or Falcon Spotlight subscriptions.


-- Content update deployment phases --

Content updates are deployed in phases to allow for rigorous testing and quality assurance and to give you more control over when the hosts in your environment receive updates.

Content updates are deployed globally according to this schedule:

• Early access: After successful internal testing and deployment to CrowdStrike assets, content updates are deployed to hosts configured for early access (EA).
• General availability: After a successful deployment to EA hosts, a grace period of 12-24 hours is enforced to ensure proper functionality. After the grace period, content updates are deployed to hosts configured for general availability (GA).
• General availability plus a delay: If a policy is configured with a delay, such as GA plus 4 hours, after a successful deployment to GA hosts, content updates are deployed to hosts configured for GA with a delay according to the delay duration. For example, GA with a delay of 4 hours indicates that these hosts start to receive updates 4 hours after a successful deployment to all GA hosts has completed.

You can view the current global deployment status of a content package update. Go to Dashboards and reports > Dashboards > Content quality dashboard . See View content package updates deployment status .
Your hosts receive content updates according to your policy configurations. See Content Update Policies .
You can view details about when a specific host received content updates in host management. See View content update states .
