-- Content updates trigger --

Use the Content updates trigger to configure a workflow to send a notification when content update release notes are published.
By default, the Content updates trigger includes all content categories. If you want to configure the workflow to only send notifications for certain content types, create a condition using the Category parameter.
To streamline your content update release notes email notifications workflow, use this playbook: Send a notification when content update release notes are available.
For more info about content categories, see About Content Updates . For more info about creating workflows, see Fusion SOAR .

Important: The channel file release notes notifications experience that's configured in the CrowdStrike Customer Center continues for the Rapid Response Content - Behavioral IOAs content category until it transitions to the new Falcon Fusion SOAR workflow in an upcoming release.

• Message type: Select a value of HTML to ensure the best formatting for the email notifications.
