Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
Block Ciphers
Stream Ciphers


Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. In this method, both the sender and the receiver share a secret key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Symmetric encryption is fast and efficient but can face challenges in key distribution and management.


Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

Symmetric encryption algorithms can be categorized into two main types: block ciphers and stream ciphers.

Block Ciphers
Block ciphers process data in fixed-size blocks, performing encryption and decryption operations on each block using a specific algorithm and key.

1. DES (Data Encryption Standard)

    Developed by IBM in the 1970s and accepted as a standard by the U.S. government in 1977.
    Uses a 56-bit key length.
    It is no longer widely used due to insufficient security.

2. 3DES (Triple DES)

    Developed to address the security weaknesses of DES.
    Performs encryption using DES three times (encrypt-decrypt-encrypt).
    Uses a 168-bit key length.

3. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

    Accepted as a standard by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in 2001.
    Supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
    It is widely used due to its security and speed.


Stream Ciphers

Stream ciphers process data as a stream of bits or bytes, performing encryption and decryption operations on the data stream. This method is especially suitable for encrypting data streams.
