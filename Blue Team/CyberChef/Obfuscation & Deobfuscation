-- Understanding the Gibberish --

Obfuscation is the practice of making data hard to read and analyze. Attackers use it to evade basic detection and delay investigations. 
Let us say, a security tool will automatically block any file that contains the word the bandit yeti. To evade this, attackers can use a simple cipher technique called "ROT1" to hide the string.
ROT1 is a cipher technique that shifts each letter forward by 1 in the alphabet. The letter a becomes b, b becomes c, and so on. Using this cipher, carrot coins go brr becomes dbsspu dpjot hp css.
This can be further complicated by using ROT13, which moves the characters forward by 13 spaces.


-- Obfuscation in the Real World --

One slightly more complicated technique would be utilizing XOR. Each character is represented as a byte, and each byte is combined with a key using the XOR mathematical operation. No need to go into the details as to how it works. 
The only thing you need to know is that this operation changes the bytes into different bytes, which sometimes makes the resulting text end up with uncommon symbols or non-readable characters.

1. Open CyberChef by visiting this link in your browser.
2. At the top right, you’ll see an Input box. This is where you paste the text you want to change/obfuscate. In our case, use carrot supremacy.
3. In the left pane under Operations, search for “XOR” and drag it into the middle under Recipe. This tells CyberChef to apply that technique to your Input text.
4. Each operation has settings you can adjust. In our case, we set the Key to a. Make sure that the dropdown next to Key is set to HEX.
5. The obfuscated result should automatically appear in the Output section. If it doesn’t, click BAKE! at the bottom of the screen.

The string carrot supremacy now becomes ikxxe~*yzxogkis!


-- Detecting Patterns --

You can use these quick visual clues to guess the obfuscation technique used:

• ROT1 - common words look “one letter off”, spaces stay the same. Easy enough to detect.
• ROT13 - Look for three-letter words. Common ones like  the become gur. And and becomes naq. spaces stay the same.
• Base64 - Long strings containing mostly alphanumeric characters (i.e., A-Z, a-z, 0–9), sometimes with + or /, often ending in = or ==.
• XOR - A bit more tricky. Looks like random symbols but stays the same length as the original. If a short secret was reused, you may notice a tiny repeat every few characters.

To deobfuscate Base64 you use From Base64 instead of To Base64.


-- Unfamiliar Patterns --

Not sure what you’re looking at? It's fine. Even if you don't have an idea of what cipher was used, it is easy enough to keep on trying different operations just to see if the text becomes readable.

CyberChef also includes an operation called Magic that automatically guesses and tries common decoders for you. To use it, just add the Magic operation and look at the results. 
It will display multiple results and it's up to you to check which one ends up making sense. You can even check "Intensive mode" to make sure it tests more possibilities before giving up.


-- Layered Obfuscation --

To make deobfuscation harder, threat actors would often combine multiple techniques, almost like a layered approach.

For example, a script that threat actors want hidden can be compressed with gzip, XOR'ed with a x key, then finally Base64-encoded will produce this obfuscated string: 
H4sIADKZ42gA/32PT2sqQRDE7/MpitGDgrPEJJcXyOGha1xwVaLwyLvI6rbuhP3HTHswm/3uzmggIQfrUD3VzI/u7iDXljepNkFth6KDmYsWnBF2R2OoZOyrPCUDXSKB1UWdEzjZ5hQI8c9oJrU4cn1kyPXbMgRW0X/nF8WLcTSJwvFX9Jr/jUP5i1NOgPeLfjxvtKQQL8RqlOk8jZgKfGJSmTDZZWqxfacdoxFAl0814Rl6j153EyxXkR1VJSe6JNNHAzmOXiHRgnJLPk+iWeiyR63+uIm6Hb5B92NG5YGzK5sm7FnfTSxfzl3rgoJ1tWKjy0NPnpxUHKs0xXT6VBSy7zjZ3A3UY4tmOPjTAs29t4dWQu2vpwyua7niJ7iyCeZJQaIVZ/xwdy/JAQAA

To reverse this kind of layered obfuscation, apply the operations in the opposite order: Base64-decode, XOR with x, then decompress gzip.
