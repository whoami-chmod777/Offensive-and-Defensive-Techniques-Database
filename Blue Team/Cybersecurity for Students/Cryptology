-- Basic Concepts of Cryptology --

What is Cryptology
The science that designs crypto algorithms that provide data security in communication infrastructures and research the reliability of these algorithms is called "Cryptology". “Cryptology” is a science that is based on encryption and decryption, which is usually the expertise of mathematicians. For the science of cryptology, it can be said that consist of the intersection of mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Cryptology science is a very broad science and is divided into 2 itself: "Cryptography" and "Cryptanalysis". 

What is Plaintext
"Plaintext" is a readable and understandable text or piece of text. In cryptology, plaintext means unencrypted data. 

What is Ciphertext
"Ciphertext" is the value produced as a result of the algorithm after the plaintext is given as an input to a crypto algorithm. In cryptology, ciphertext means encrypted data.

What is Cryptography
"Cryptography" is the whole of the techniques used to transform the transmitted information into a form that cannot be understood by unauthorized people. Cryptography includes mathematical methods that try to provide the basic objectives of information security such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. 
"Cryptography" is the science that converts plaintext to ciphertext with the crypto algorithm. The algorithm in the encryption process is one of the main focuses. The method used by the encryption algorithm is one of the factors that determine the reliability of the algorithm. 

What is Cryptanalysis
"Cryptanalysis" is a branch of cryptology that examines the security of crypto algorithms in order to decrypt the encrypted data and tries to find their weaknesses. “Cryptanalysis” tries to detect mathematical vulnerabilities in the crypto algorithm in order to convert ciphertext to plaintext. 

What is Encryption
The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext is called "Encryption". There is an algorithm used mathematically in the encryption process. 

What is Decryption
The process of converting ciphertext into plaintext is called decryption. As in the encryption process, an algorithm is used in this process. 

What is the Key
The "Key" is a value given as input to encryption and decryption algorithms. Using this value, the encryption and decryption process is applied. 

What is Encoding/Decoding
"Encoding" is often confused with encryption as a concept. In fact, the two terms are used for very different purposes. Encoding is the process of converting data into a specific character set form. Unlike encryption algorithms, it is a conversion algorithm that is used without using key values ​​and without security concerns. There is also the opposite of the encoding process. For example, one of the most frequently used encoding algorithms is the "base64" algorithm. “Decoding” is the opposite of encoding algorithms. The encoded data with the decoding process will turn into previous data.

- Types of Cryptography -

• Symmetric Ciphers
• Asymmetric Ciphers
• Protocols

Symmetric Ciphers
Symmetric encryption algorithms are cryptographic algorithms that use the same key in encryption and decryption operations. For example, after you have encrypted the plaintext, you can decrypt the result obtained with the same key again. 

Asymmetric Ciphers
In this type of cryptosystem, which is introduced as "Public-key cryptography" or "asymmetric cryptography", two different keys are used instead of a single key. One of these keys is the "secret key" and the other is the "public key". Different keys are used in encryption and decryption processes for asymmetric crypto algorithms. While “public key” is used for encryption, “secret key” or in other words “private key” is used for decryption. 

Protocols
Cryptographic protocols deal with the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Symmetric and asymmetric crypto algorithms are used in the security infrastructure of many software. An example of the protocols in which these algorithms are applied is the "Transport Layer Security (TLS)" protocol. In this type of cryptographic protocol, symmetric and asymmetric crypto algorithms are generally used together. This is called “Hybrid Schemes”.


-- Historical Ciphers --

The Substitution Cipher
The substitution cipher is an old and simple crypto algorithm. "Substitution Cipher" is an algorithm that works with the logic of replacing letters in the alphabet with another letter. 

Shift Cipher (or Caesar Cipher)
Caesar Cipher takes its name from the Roman leader "Julius Caesar". Julius Caesar developed a crypto algorithm to secretly transmit messages of military importance at that time, which was quite simple and changed each letter by scrolling over the alphabet. 
Shift Cipher is one of the substitution cipher types. Shift cipher is an algorithm that works by sequentially shifting letters in the alphabet. In this algorithm, the key is the value that indicates how many times the alphabet will be shifted. 
For example with the key "3", when 3 letters are shifted to the left for decryption
