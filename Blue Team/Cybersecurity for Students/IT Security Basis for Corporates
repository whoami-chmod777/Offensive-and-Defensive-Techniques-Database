-- Inventory --

Protecting your infrastructure requires knowing what devices are connected to your network, what applications are being used, who has access to them, and what security measures are in place.

➜ What should your inventory contain and why?

As with all IT security issues, you will need a complete inventory. This inventory should include at least the following information:
• the hardware of each workstation and server 
• the software installed with the exact version 
• the date of the last report

➜ End-of-Life Equipment

Equipment that is no longer maintained is equipment that will no longer receive security patches. It is then necessary to exclude from your network all the equipment that cannot be maintained. In case of extreme necessity, a risk acceptance by a CISO(Chief Information Security Officer) must be performed and traced in your inventory. This analysis must be reviewed at regular intervals, ideally at each new vulnerability discovered.

➜ Secure Boot

The secure boot must be enabled on all your compatible devices. This feature ensures that the computer boots using only manufacturer-approved software. This is a feature that has been available for 10 years, so it is unlikely that a problem will occur if you have standard usage.

➜ Softwares List

In order to reduce the attack surface, it is important that your company has a strict policy regarding authorized and unauthorized software.

⇒ Allowed Softwares: To do so, the use of GPO (Group Policy Object) or Intune allows you to provide your users with a quickly available software library without the need for administrative rights to its stations. This avoids that your users have to download the installation programs themselves and therefore limits the risk of downloading a malicious program.
⇒ Forbidden Softwares: In the same way, whether via Intune or AppLocker, it is necessary to block software identified as forbidden (either because you do not legitimize the application or because its version is subject to a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that is dangerous for you). Each use of a prohibited application must be reported to your company's IT team.

➜ Security Hardening

Does your company rely on proven hardening guides to define the configuration of your devices? These hardening guidelines can cover different levels such as:
• Station handover procedures with prerequisite checklist
• Audit of the secure configuration of the devices 
• Alert in case of configuration modification

This hardening can be done in several ways, such as Ansible, GPO, or Intune.

➜ Antivirus / EDR

Make sure that your company deploys an antivirus, or even an EDR on the entire fleet, starting with the devices that are critical to your business. Do not forget to set up a follow-up of the generated alerts.


-- Backups --

Backups are your last line of defense. A non-operational backup system following an attack could jeopardize the survival of your business.

➜ Rule 3-2-1

As a basic rule and the minimum expected for an infrastructure, the 3-2-1 rule states that you must:
• Have at least three copies of your data 
• Store on two different media
• One of which must be an offsite external backup

⇒ Three Copies: The principle is to have your data on the server and two backups. This is to avoid that a failure makes your backups inoperative.
⇒ Two Different Media: Here, two media should not be understood as necessarily two different physical formats (hard disk and LTO tape) but as having one's backup on two different and unrelated points. Thus, it is possible to have two copies of the backup on hard disks if the two are not stored in the same datacenter, not linked via the same software RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks), etc.
⇒ One Offsite External Backup: The idea behind this request is to have a backup stored outside your building that contains the main data to protect against risks such as fire.

➜ Rule 3-2-1-1-0

This rule is to be applied at least on the critical resources of your company. Identical to the 3-2-1 rule, it adds two conditions: 
• 1 offline copy
• 0 errors during the restoration

⇒ One Offline Copy: This is about having a backup that is not connected to your network and any IT infrastructure. The goal is to avoid that if an attacker has compromised your network, he can intervene on this backup.
⇒ Zero Errors During The Restoration: This point seems logical, but it is advisable to regularly test the backups made and check that they can be restored without errors. It would be a shame if once restored, it is discovered that a file on the database server is actually damaged.

➜ Minimum Storage Time

It is important that the backups allow to restore at least 30 days old data. Why 30 days? Because the average time between the intrusion in the park and the detection by the company is about this time.

➜ Backup Tests

Now that your data is backed up according to best practices, it is important to ensure that your test restores are tracked and that each server is restored at least once a year.


-- Phishing Prevention --

Phishing attacks represent one of the biggest initial attack vectors along with the exploitation of vulnerabilities on your online servers.
