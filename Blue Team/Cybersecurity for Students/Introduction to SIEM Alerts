- Introduction to SIEM Alerts -

LetsDefend's Practice page provides hands-on exercises and simulations to deepen the understanding of the SIEM alert investigation process in a simulated Security Operations Centre (SOC) environment. This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of alert analysis and how to get the most out of the exercises and simulations.

What Will You Learn
The more alerts you close, the faster you can respond to new attacks and handle the hundreds of alerts that come through any security operations center, as these alerts cover many of the techniques used by real threat actors.
Improved Analysis Skills: Enhance your alert analysis abilities by utilizing advanced techniques, allowing for more precise identification of potential threats and anomalies.

• Tool Familiarity: Gain hands-on experience with common cybersecurity tools used in SOCs.
• Log Analysis: Gain valuable insight into how to locate logs and detect malicious activity to effectively identify and respond to security threats.
• Improved Incident Response: Enhance your ability to swiftly and effectively respond to security incidents, minimizing potential damage and reducing downtime.
• Enhanced Threat Intelligence: Gain valuable insight into evolving threats and attack techniques by analyzing and resolving alerts, empowering proactive defense strategies.
• Continuous Improvement: Stay on top of emerging threats and solve alerts to improve your preparedness and response capabilities.


- Detection -

SIEM alerts are notifications generated by the SIEM system based on predefined rules and correlation algorithms. These rules are typically customized to meet an organization's specific security requirements. When an event matches the defined criteria, the SIEM system triggers an alert.
In LetsDefend, alerts are prepared and continuously updated by cybersecurity experts. These alerts cover a range of threats, from the most common attacks used by adversaries to the most sophisticated zero-day exploits. 

Monitoring
This section introduces you to the "Monitoring" page. Divided into three sections, the Monitoring page acts as a dashboard for viewing generated alerts. These sections are:

• Main Channel
• Investigation Channel
• Closed Alerts

Main Channel
The default view of the Monitoring page displays all open incidents available for ownership. Within the Main Channel, you'll find fields displaying key details about the triggered alerts, including:

• Severity : Indicates the level of severity, categorized as Low , Medium , High , or Critical .
• Date : Displays the date of the incident. (UTC +0 Timezone)
• Rule Name : Identifies the specific rule triggered by the event.
• EventID : Provides a unique identifier for the event.
• Type : Specifies the type of event or alert triggered.
• Action : Assigns ownership of the alert to you for further investigation and analysis.

 You can refine the alerts displayed based on Severity, Type, and Role criteria using the Filter button in the top left corner. 

Taking Ownership
Once you have decided which alert you want to investigate, click on it to access further details. The alert details provide comprehensive insight into various aspects of the alert. Next, use the 'Take ownership' option in the top right-hand corner. This action will assign the alert to you for further analysis and investigation. 
Upon taking ownership of the alert, it is automatically sent to the investigation channel, where you can initiate the case to further analyze and respond to the security incident. 

Investigation Channel
The Investigation Channel is designed for managing and responding to active alerts. When an alert is assigned to you, it will appear in this channel. From here, you can create a case to investigate the alert in more detail. 
When you create a case for an alert, the 'Case Management' page opens immediately, allowing you to start the playbook. From the Case Management page, you can view the details of the incident and start the Playbook, which is a pre-arranged series of instructions that guide you through the processes of the investigation. 

Playbooks
There are many different types of alerts (web attacks, ransomware, malware, phishing, etc.) in the SOC (Security Operations Centre) environment. The methods and approaches for investigating these alerts are different. Workflows for effective and consistent analysis of alerts generated by SIEM or other security tools are called playbooks.
For example, when you click the 'Create Case' button for an alert on the LetsDefend monitoring page, a ticket is automatically created in the 'Case Management'. The system will assign a specific playbook to it and provide you with the necessary steps to properly investigate the alert by following the instructions. 

Why Are Playbooks Important?
As SOC analysts, we don't always know the exact steps to take when dealing with alerts. Playbooks help by providing a clear, step-by-step process to follow during an investigation. This is especially helpful for new analysts just starting their SOC careers. 

Closing the Alert
Once the playbook has been completed and all inquiries have been dealt with, including the analysis phase, we need to return to the Monitoring page within the Investigation channel to officially close the alert.
The alert needs to be analyzed to determine if it is a true positive or a false positive. A true positive means that the alert is legitimate and requires further action, whereas a false positive means that the alert is a false alarm. 
Once you've completed your analysis, you should document your findings in the Analyst Note section. The document should include your reasoning, relevant data or observations, and steps taken during your investigation. It is critical as it provides a record of your analysis and can be used for future reference or in resolving similar alerts.
Once the alert is closed, you can review the details of your analysis in the Closed Alerts section. Here you'll find the answers you provided to the Playbook questions, confirming your accurate assessment of the situation. 
For further insight into the investigation process and additional context around the alert, you can also access the official incident report or community walkthrough. These resources offer valuable information for understanding the threat landscape and improving future response efforts.
