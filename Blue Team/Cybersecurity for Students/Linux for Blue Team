-- Introduction to Linux --

What is Linux
Linux is one of the kernel software, which is the most basic part of computer operating systems. It is a free software project released under the GNU General Public License version 2 and developed under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation. The name Linux was given by its first developer, Linus Torvalds, in 1991.

Benefits of Linux 
Linux is famous for its command line. The power of the command line is an opportunity for cybersecurity professionals working in the cybersecurity industry because the use of Linux's command line can make many things easier and provide flexibility in application practice in cyber security projects and operations. It can save time. SOC analysts usually work on high dimensional data and Linux can easily handle the use of high dimensional data with the command line. 

Common Linux distributions 
• Ubuntu
• CentOS
• Fedora
• Debian
• Red Hat Enterprise Linux
• Linux Mint
• Open SUSE
• Manjaro


-- Linux File System Hierarchy --

Explanation for what purpose each directory in the Linux file system hierarchy is used and what type of files it contains

What is Filesystem Hierarchy
As in every operating system, Linux has a filing system as well. Everything in the Linux operating system consists of files. When all the files come together, they form all the components of the operating system. Files are in a grouped order by directories. In Linux, directories are in a hierarchical order. Hierarchical order means that one directory can be above or below another. In the Linux operating system, the directory structure must conform to a certain standard.

"/" - Root Directory
The directory used as the top directory in the entire file hierarchy in Linux is the "Root Directory". The root directory is expressed with “/” and each directory to be written to the right is under the root directory. For example, the “/bin” directory means the directory named "bin” under the “/” directory. In other words, a parent directory of the "bin" directory is the "/"(root directory). 

/bin Directory
It is the directory where the binary files of the executable commands are located. The executable binary files of the basic commands are located under this directory.

/boot Directory
The files that are needed when the operating system is first turned on, during the loading of the kernel are located under the boot directory.

/dev Directory
The /dev directory contains the device files on the system that are recognized by Linux. Access to the disks on the system is made under this directory. For example “/dev/sda1” refers to a device. This device is a disk or a disk partition.

/etc Directory
The /etc directory is the directory that contains the configuration files on the system. It is one of the most important directories on Linux in terms of security. For example, the encrypted version of the users' passwords is kept under this directory.

/home Directory
The /home directory is the directory where users have various personal files. Downloaded files, documents, and user-specific files can be found under this directory. Since the files under this directory can give an idea about the user, they may be of interest to attackers in terms of security. Therefore, it is one of the directories that the SOC analyst should carefully examine. The size of this directory may vary depending on the user's activity. By default, when a new user is created, a new directory belonging to the user is created in the "/home" directory. However, because it is not mandatory, attackers do not usually create a new directory under the "/home" directory for newly created users.

/lib Directory
Under the /lib directory, there are the library files used by the executable binaries in the system.

/media Directory
The /media directory is the directory where the removable media, such as CD-ROM and USB, are mounted.

/mnt Directory
The /mnt directory is the directory where the temporarily mounted file systems are located.

/opt Directory
The /opt directory is the directory where the application software needed to be installed on the system additionally.

/proc Directory
The /proc directory is the directory that contains the files that hold information about the current status of the running processes on the system.

/root Directory
The most authorized user in Linux is the "Root" user. The root user also has a directory that contains its own files, like other users on the system. This directory is the "/root" directory. This directory can contain critical information just like any other user directory. Therefore, SOC analysts should control access to this directory separately.
The "/root" directory should not be confused with the "/" directory. The “/” directory is the topmost directory on the system. The “/root” directory is a directory under the “/” directory and belongs to the root user.

/run Directory
The /run directory is the directory that holds information about the running system since the last boot of the system.

/sbin Directory
The /sbin directory is the directory where the binaries of executable commands are located. Usually, only the root users can run executable binaries under this directory.

/srv Directory
The /srv directory is the directory that contains the data for the services offered by the system. For example, the data of services such as TFTP or FTP are located under this directory.

/tmp Directory
The /tmp directory is the directory where temporary files are stored. Usually, the files under the "/tmp" directory are deleted during the system reboot. When analyzing a live Linux system, the cyber security specialist who responded to the incident should examine the "/tmp" directory in order to access critical data that may be deleted.

/usr Directory
The /usr directory is the directory containing executable binaries, libraries, and other files that all users of the system can access with read-only privileges.

/var Directory
The /var directory is known as the variable directory and contains system logs, files for tracking user activity, and cache files. It contains the logs that must be checked by the SOC analyst. According to the logs in the "/var" directory, the SOC analyst can see the unauthorized access to the system and take the necessary action.

What is the Command Line
The command line is an intermediary program that receives commands from the user via the keyboard and transfers the commands to the operating system for execution. The command line in Linux is called "shell". There are many types of shells supported on Linux.
