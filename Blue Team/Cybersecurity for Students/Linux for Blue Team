-- Introduction to Linux --

What is Linux
Linux is one of the kernel software, which is the most basic part of computer operating systems. It is a free software project released under the GNU General Public License version 2 and developed under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation. The name Linux was given by its first developer, Linus Torvalds, in 1991.

Benefits of Linux 
Linux is famous for its command line. The power of the command line is an opportunity for cybersecurity professionals working in the cybersecurity industry because the use of Linux's command line can make many things easier and provide flexibility in application practice in cyber security projects and operations. It can save time. SOC analysts usually work on high dimensional data and Linux can easily handle the use of high dimensional data with the command line. 

Common Linux distributions 
• Ubuntu
• CentOS
• Fedora
• Debian
• Red Hat Enterprise Linux
• Linux Mint
• Open SUSE
• Manjaro


-- Linux File System Hierarchy --

Explanation for what purpose each directory in the Linux file system hierarchy is used and what type of files it contains

What is Filesystem Hierarchy
As in every operating system, Linux has a filing system as well. Everything in the Linux operating system consists of files. When all the files come together, they form all the components of the operating system. Files are in a grouped order by directories. In Linux, directories are in a hierarchical order. Hierarchical order means that one directory can be above or below another. In the Linux operating system, the directory structure must conform to a certain standard.

"/" - Root Directory
The directory used as the top directory in the entire file hierarchy in Linux is the "Root Directory". The root directory is expressed with “/” and each directory to be written to the right is under the root directory. For example, the “/bin” directory means the directory named "bin” under the “/” directory. In other words, a parent directory of the "bin" directory is the "/"(root directory). 

/bin Directory
It is the directory where the binary files of the executable commands are located. The executable binary files of the basic commands are located under this directory.

/boot Directory
The files that are needed when the operating system is first turned on, during the loading of the kernel are located under the boot directory.

/dev Directory
The /dev directory contains the device files on the system that are recognized by Linux. Access to the disks on the system is made under this directory. For example “/dev/sda1” refers to a device. This device is a disk or a disk partition.

/etc Directory
The /etc directory is the directory that contains the configuration files on the system. It is one of the most important directories on Linux in terms of security. For example, the encrypted version of the users' passwords is kept under this directory.

/home Directory
The /home directory is the directory where users have various personal files. Downloaded files, documents, and user-specific files can be found under this directory. Since the files under this directory can give an idea about the user, they may be of interest to attackers in terms of security. Therefore, it is one of the directories that the SOC analyst should carefully examine. The size of this directory may vary depending on the user's activity. By default, when a new user is created, a new directory belonging to the user is created in the "/home" directory. However, because it is not mandatory, attackers do not usually create a new directory under the "/home" directory for newly created users.

/lib Directory
Under the /lib directory, there are the library files used by the executable binaries in the system.

/media Directory
The /media directory is the directory where the removable media, such as CD-ROM and USB, are mounted.

/mnt Directory
The /mnt directory is the directory where the temporarily mounted file systems are located.

/opt Directory
The /opt directory is the directory where the application software needed to be installed on the system additionally.

/proc Directory
The /proc directory is the directory that contains the files that hold information about the current status of the running processes on the system.

/root Directory
The most authorized user in Linux is the "Root" user. The root user also has a directory that contains its own files, like other users on the system. This directory is the "/root" directory. This directory can contain critical information just like any other user directory. Therefore, SOC analysts should control access to this directory separately.
The "/root" directory should not be confused with the "/" directory. The “/” directory is the topmost directory on the system. The “/root” directory is a directory under the “/” directory and belongs to the root user.

/run Directory
The /run directory is the directory that holds information about the running system since the last boot of the system.

/sbin Directory
The /sbin directory is the directory where the binaries of executable commands are located. Usually, only the root users can run executable binaries under this directory.

/srv Directory
The /srv directory is the directory that contains the data for the services offered by the system. For example, the data of services such as TFTP or FTP are located under this directory.

/tmp Directory
The /tmp directory is the directory where temporary files are stored. Usually, the files under the "/tmp" directory are deleted during the system reboot. When analyzing a live Linux system, the cyber security specialist who responded to the incident should examine the "/tmp" directory in order to access critical data that may be deleted.

/usr Directory
The /usr directory is the directory containing executable binaries, libraries, and other files that all users of the system can access with read-only privileges.

/var Directory
The /var directory is known as the variable directory and contains system logs, files for tracking user activity, and cache files. It contains the logs that must be checked by the SOC analyst. According to the logs in the "/var" directory, the SOC analyst can see the unauthorized access to the system and take the necessary action. 


-- Basic Terminal Commands --

What is the Command Line
The command line is an intermediary program that receives commands from the user via the keyboard and transfers the commands to the operating system for execution. The command line in Linux is called "shell". There are many types of shells supported on Linux. 

Command Line Structure
When the command line window is opened, we see a structure with a cursor waiting for a command from the user. This structure is as follows: username@hostname:current_directory$
In this structure, the part before the "@" sign represents the username. The part from the "@" sign to the ":" sign represents the hostname. The part from the “:” to the “$” sign indicates which directory it is being worked on. The "$" sign on the far right is the last element in this structure. In the command line of the root user, who is the most authorized user in the system, the "#" sign is used instead of the "$" sign at the end of this structure. 

whatis Command
The whatis command allows us to view a single line of brief information about commands running on the command line. For example, let's execute the whatis command itself together with the whatis command.
For example: whatis whatis
It printed the one-line description of the whatis command to the screen

help Command
The help command is one of the information commands that gives a more detailed output than the whatis command. 
For example help cd

man Command
The man command is the command that provides the most detailed information about the commands and programs on the command line. It has a specific writing format. It offers very detailed content from descriptions to parameters. 
For example: man whatis

pwd Command
The pwd command stands for "print working directory". It is the command that shows the working directory. For example
For example: pwd

cd Command
The cd command is the command to switch between directories. It stands for "change directory". When switching between directories with the cd command, the path of the target directory must be specified. 

a. Absolute Path
Absolute path is a notation written to indicate all subdirectories from the root directory ("/") to the current directory. 

b. Relative Path
Relative path, unlike absolute path, is to write the part after the current directory instead of typing the full path of the directory to be traversed from the root directory(“/”)

Changing directory with current directory (".") sign
The "." sign indicates the current directory. For example: xs ./letsdefend/

d. Changing directory with parent directory ("..") sign
With the ".." (parent directory) sign, we can switch to a parent directory of the current directory. 

e. Switching to the home directory with the home directory ("~") sign
With the "~" (home directory) sign, it is possible to switch to the home directory of the current user. For example: cd ~

f. Switching to the last directory with the Previous directory sign ("-")
With the "-" (previous directory) sign, it is possible to switch to the previous directory, regardless of which directory it is. For example: cd -

ls Command
The ls command is the command to list directories and files. With this command, directories and files under a directory can be viewed. It is one of the most important commands. It can have a very functional use with its parameters. 
For example: ls

a. Viewing hidden files and directories with the ls command
The ls command does not show hidden files when used without parameters. In order to see hidden files, the ls command must be given the "-a" parameter.
The difference between the display of hidden files and normal files is the "." sign in the beginning. As seen in the image above, hidden files were not displayed when the ls command was used without the "-a" parameter. 

b. Getting detailed information about directories and files with the ls command
When the ls command is used with the "-l" parameter, it provides detailed information about the files/directories it lists. This information includes the permissions of the file/directory, the owner of the file/directory the name of the user, the owner of the file/directory the name of the group, the size of the file/directory, the date the file/directory was last modified, and the name of the file/directory. 
For example: ls -a

c. Using multiple parameters with the ls command
It is possible to obtain the desired output by using more than one parameter while executing the ls command. 
For example: ls -al, ls -lah

touch Command
The touch command is the command to create a new empty file via the command line. 
For example: touch testfile.txt

mkdir Command
The mkdir command is the command to create a new directory. It is possible to create multiple directories at once with the mkdir command.
For example: mkdir dir1, mkdir dir2 dir3 dir4

mv Command
The mv command is the command used to rename and move files. With the mv command, we can change the file name as follows
For example: mv oldfile newfile
First, the old file name is written as a parameter after the mv command. As the second parameter, the new file name is written.

In file transfer operations with the mv command, after the mv command, the path where the source file is located is given as the first parameter, and the destination path is given as the second parameter. 
For example: mv movedfile ../incident

cp Command
The cp command is the command used in file/directory copy operations. The first parameter in the cp command is the path of the file/directory to be copied. The second parameter is the target path. 
For example: cp copyfile ../SOC/

It is possible to copy nested directories with the cp command. The "-r" parameter should be used for this operation. 
For example,: cp -r '../soc/directory4/'

rm Command
The rm command is the command used to delete files and directories. When deleting directories with the rm command, the "-r" parameter should be used additionally. 
For example: rm file1, rm -r directory1

cat Command
The cat command is the command used for reading from the file. The path of the file to be read is given as a parameter.

echo Command
The echo command is the command used for printing to the screen. 
When the echo command and redirection operators are used together, printing to the file can be done. These operators are the “>” and “>>” operators. The “>” operator prints the value of the parameter given to the echo command to the file in the parameter that follows 
If the target file content is full, the “>” operator deletes the existing text and prints the specified new expression to the file.
When printing to a file with the “>” operator, if the target file does not exist, it is created and the content is saved in the created file.
If you want to keep the old text by adding to the end of the existing file content, the “>>” operator should be used.

For example: echo BlueTeam, echo "Hello Linux" > note, echo "Hello My Friend" >> note

more Command
The more command is a command that allows reading the contents of long files. The expression “%” in the lower-left indicates which part of the file is read as a percentage. 
There are two conveniences for reading in this interactive environment. These are the "Enter" and "Space" keys on the keyboard. The file can be read by scrolling down line by line with the "Enter" key. A new page comes up with the "Space" button. 
Pressing the "q" key is sufficient to exit the interactive environment that opens with the application of “more” command. 
For example: more wordlist.txt

wc Command
The wc command is a command that counts the number of lines, the number of words and the number of characters in the file content. 
We learn the total number of lines in the file content by using the wc command with the "-l" parameter. 
We learn the total number of words in the file content by using the wc command with the "-w" parameter
We learn the total number of characters in the file content by using the wc command with the "-m" parameter. 
For example: wc -l, wc -w, wc -m

head Command
The head command is the command used to see the lines at the beginning of the file. The “-n” parameter of the head command allows to see any number of lines. 
For example: head wordlist.txt, head -n 5 wordlist.txt

tail Command
The tail command is the command used to see the lines at the end of the file. The "-n" parameter of the tail command allows to see the desired number of lines. 
For example: tail wordlist, tail -n 10 wordlist

grep Command
The grep command is a command to search within a file. The word/words to be searched are given as parameters. 
For example: grep letsdefend wordlist.txt, grep -o "d" grepme.txt | wc -l

sort Command
The sort command is the command to sort the contents of the file alphabetically. 
For example: sort list

uniq Command
The uniq command is used to reduce successive same values ​​to a single value in the file content. 
If all repetitive words, including all non-sequential words in the file content, are wanted to be printed on the screen once, sorting should be done first by applying the sort command, and then the uniq command should be applied. 
It is possible to do all these operations with a single command. "|"(pipe) sign should be used to perform this operation with a single command. 
The pipe(“|”) sign allows you to give the output of one command as input to another command. Pipe(“|”) gives the output of the command on the left as input to the command on the right.
For example: uniq list, sort list | uniq

date Command
The date command is the command that displays the system's date and time

uptime Command
The uptime command is the command that shows how long the system has been up

history Command
The history command is the command that shows the history of commands executed on the command line. 
While the History command is running, it reads the list of commands executed from a file and prints it to the screen. This file is the ".bash_history" file that is hidden under the user's home directory. 

find Command
The find command is the command used in file searches. With the find command, you can find out whether the searched file exists under a certain directory. 
For example: find ../training/ -name attack, find . -type d -name letsdefend

file Command
The file command is the command that shows the file type. In Linux, file extensions are represented. It is the header information of the file that determines the file type. The file command determines the file type according to the header information and prints it to the screen.
For example: file letsdefend.txt


-- Permissions Management --

File permissions
On Linux, each file has permissions. With these permissions, users are authorized to access related files. Management of file permissions is very important for security. The permissions of the files that each user needs to access and the permissions of the user-specific files are different.
The "ls -l" command is used to see the permissions of the files.

File permissions are shown in the leftmost column. File permissions have a unique representation. This display is divided into 4 areas: file type, user permissions, group permissions, and other permissions, respectively. For example: d | rwx | rwx | rwx
On the far left, the file type is expressed first. If it says "d" in this section, it means that it is a directory. If there is a "-" sign, it means that the file exists. The representation of the remaining 3 fields consists of the expressions "r,w,x,-". The meanings of these expressions are as follows:

r : readable
w : writable
x : executable
- : empty

There is also a numerical representation of file permissions. The expression "rwx" consists of 3 bits. In this notation, each r,w,x expression has a numerical equivalent:

4: read permission(r)
2: write permission(w)
1: execute permission(x)

Both letter and numeric notation can be used to change file permissions. 

Changing File Permissions
The "chmod" command is used when changing file permissions. The chmod command basically needs two parameters. The first of these is the parameter that contains information about the permission change. This parameter specifies which permission will be changed and whose permission will be changed. The second parameter is the file that the permissions need to be changed. 
For example: chmod u+x letsdefend.jpg

The first parameter in the command is the "u+x" parameter. In this section, the letter "u" indicates that the privileges of the user will be changed. The "+" sign indicates the change type. The "+" sign is used to authorize, if the "-" sign was used, it would mean revoking the existing authorization. The "x" sign indicates which type of authorization is used.
Instead of "x"(execute), it could be changed to "w"(write) or "r"(read). 

r w - r - - r - - : 6 4 4
r w x r - - r - - : 7 4 4

Ownership Permissions
In Linux, each file has an owner as user and group. Ownership information can be viewed with the "ls -l" command.
The "chown" command is used to change the owner of the file. 

The owner of the file is the "debian" user. 

-rw-r--r-- 1 debian debian 16243 Apr 2 09:02 Letsdefend.jpg 

For example: sudo chown letsdefend letsdefend.jpg

-rw-r--r-- 1 letsdefend debian 16243 Apr 2 09:02 Letsdefend.jpg 

The one on the right represents the owner group. If we want to change the owner group, the command we need to apply is the "chgrp" command. 

For example: sudo chgrp letsdefend letsdefend.jpg

-rw-r--r-- 1 letsdefend debian 16243 Apr 2 09:02 Letsdefend.jpg 


-- User Management and Groups --

Users and Groups
In order to be able to perform any operation on Linux, it is absolutely necessary to have a user. That's why Linux users are very important. The target of the attacker trying to take over the target Linux system is to seize the most authorized user account. The most authorized user on Linux is the "root" user. The root user has no restrictions on the system. The root user should be very careful while running commands on the system because if the root user runs a wrong command, it may have irreversible results that impact the system in a negative way. 
The target for attackers is always to have the privileges of the root user. 

whoami command
The whoami command is the command that shows which user is operating on the command line being worked on. 

The Concept of UID (User ID) ve GID (Group ID)
In Linux, each user and group has its own identification number. The identification number for users is called UID (user id) and GID (group ID) for groups.Id values ​​are used in definitions for operations on the system. 
In Linux-based operating systems, the "root" user has a UID of "0" by default. Users newly added to the operating system usually start from the "1000" UID value and increase with the increments of 1. Generally, service users have a UID value between "1" and "999"
For example: id -u

Finding out the groups the user belongs to
The "id" command can be used to see the groups that the user belongs to. 

/etc/shadow File
"/etc/shadow" file is an important file on the system that keeps the encrypted versions of the passwords of the users. 

Looking at the file permissions, read permission is not granted for other. So the file contents could not be read by the debian user. In such cases, there are some methods to read files that are accessible to the root user.
One of these methods is to apply the sudo command, which allows to act as the root user. The sudo command stands for "superuser do". The sudo command is a command that allows normal users to act as root. The user must be in the sudo group to be able to execute this command. In order to use the sudo command, it is necessary to know the password of the current user because this password information will be requested when the sudo command is executed. 
For example: sudo cat /etc/shadow

The "/etc/shadow" file contains the following information, respectively:

• Username.
• Encrypted password.
• Date of the last password changed - expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970. If there is a 0 that means the user should change their password the next time they log in.
• Minimum password age - Days that a user will have to wait before being able to change their password again.
• Maximum password age - Maximum number of days before a user has to change their password.
• Password warning period - Number of days before a password is going to expire.
• Password inactivity period - Number of days after a password has expired to allow login with their password.
• Account expiration date - the date that the user will not be able to log in.
• Reserved field for future use.

/etc/passwd File
The /etc/passwd file is a file where the entire user list in the system can be seen. It contains detailed information about users. Unlike the shadow file, the “/etc/passwd” file can be read by normal users.

The "/etc/passwd" file contains the following information, respectively:

• Username
• User's password - the password is not really stored in this file, it's usually stored in the /etc/shadow file. You can see many different symbols that are in this field, if you see an "x" that means the password is stored in the /etc/shadow file, a "*" means the user doesn't have login access, and if there is a blank field that means the user doesn't have a password.
• The user ID - as you can see root has the UID of 0
• The group ID
• GECOS field - This is used to generally leave comments about the user or account such as their real name or phone number, it is comma-delimited.
• User's home directory
• User's shell - you'll probably see a lot of users defaulting to bash for their shell

To Create a New User
It is possible to create a new user with the "useradd" command 
For example: sudo useradd tempuser

To Delete an Existing User
It is possible to delete an existing user with the command "userdel"
For example: sudo userdel tempuser

Changing User Password
It is possible to change users' passwords with the "passwd" command. 
For example: sudo passwd letsdefend_user

User Switch in Command Line
It is possible to switch the user on the command line with the "su" command. The name of the user to be actively used is entered as a parameter with the "su" command.
For example: su letsdefend, sudo su -
