-- How Malware Analysis Help SOC Analysts --

As a Security Analyst, you should be able to analyze and figure out whether these files are harmful; and, if it is malicious, you should understand the purpose of this software and how it communicates with the command and control servers. It is an undeniable fact that malware analysis is an indispensable know-how for Security Analysts.


-- Malware Definition --

The word Malware is a word derived from the words MALicious softWARE. It is the name given to software that endangers the security and integrity of systems by targeting a malicious purpose.
Today, cyber threat actors use malicious software to achieve various purposes such as ensuring persistence, damaging systems, demanding ransom. As SOC analyst, we need to analyze suspicious software and understand whether the software is really harmful.
Since there is no restriction, you can come across malicious software written in almost all programming languages. You don't need to know all programming languages ​​to start analyzing malware. However, we can say that being familiar with programming makes it easy to analyze malicious software (it is even mandatory in matters such as reverse engineering).
As a SOC analyst, you will encounter many suspicious files in your daily work routine. These files may have come via email, or may have been detected by the antivirus software on the user device, or they may have been detected by the network security products while being transferred. I believe you got the point :)


-- Malware Types --

A malware may contain more than one feature, so a malware can belong to more than one type. For example, WannaCry malware includes both worm and ransomware malware features.

Backdoor
Leaving a backdoor on the device where the malware is installed, it allows the attacker to access the system through this backdoor.
For example, by opening a network port connected to the shell, it enables the attacker to connect to the system through this port.

Adware
It often comes with downloaded software, causing unwanted advertisements to be displayed on the device. While not all adware is harmful, some change the default search engine.

Ransomware
It is a type of malware that has been on the world agenda for the last few years. It demands ransom from people by encrypting and exfiltrating all files on the device.

Virus
It is one of the first types of malware seen in the wild. So we see that in daily life, it is often called a virus instead of the term malware. Viruses have a self-replicate feature. It provides persistence by infecting other files on the device.

Worm
Since this type of malware spreads from infected devices to other devices, it is named worm. WannaCry, a worm malware exploiting MS17-010 vulnerability, caused panic around the world.

Rootkit
It is a type of malware that disguises itself by providing access to a high level of authority on the device.

RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
It is a type of malware that provides full control over the device to the threat actor.

Banking malware
A type of malware that targets banking applications and causes money to be stolen from the victim.

Keylogger
A type of malware that logs pushed keys and sends this information to attacker.


-- What Should a Malware Analyst Know --

Operating System Fundamentals and Architecture
Since malware runs on operating systems, malware analysts should have a solid understanding and knowledge of the operating systems.
Malware often takes advantage of the features offered by the operating system, increasing its privileges, making discovery and ensuring persistence. To give an example on Windows operating systems, malicious software uses the features of the operating system such as Task Scheduler, Services, Registry to ensure persistence.
In addition to the features of the operating system, API, Syscalls, Memory Architecture and lower level issues are also important for successful malware analysis.

Assembly Language & Programming
When you compile any program in languages ​​such as, C/C++, Python, Java, Ruby, Go etc. compilers translate the codes you write into 0s and 1s that the processor can understand. When you start a program, these 0s and 1s are sent to the processor over the memory to run.
The lowest level programming language you can see is Assembly if we do not consider 0s and 1s. Each instruction has a direct 0 and 1 counterpart. When you compile a program written in C, it is first translated to Assembly language and then to 0s and 1s.
Compiled malware can be easily converted into the Assembly language. However, converting from Assembly language to the next level is not very easy and accurate, so analyses are usually made through Assembly language. Software that translates machine codes into Assembly language is called "Disassembler".

Network Protocols and Fundamentals
Malware often exhibits network activity in order to hijack information, connect to a command and control server, or download second payloads. Understanding these network traffics while analyzing malware is extremely important for us to understand the purpose of the malware.

Cryptography
Many technologies make use of cryptography to provide security. It is also used by attackers for purposes such as complicating, preventing detection and preventing access.
Popular ransomware uses cryptography nowadays to encrypt files and prevent access to files without paying a ransom.
