-- Introduction to Windows --

What is Windows?
Windows is the name of the operating system family that has many different versions developed by Microsoft. The Windows operating system was first released in 1985. Many versions of Windows have been released since the day it was released. It has been continuously improved in every version and it still continues to be developed. Today, it is possible to come across a Windows product in every environment where technology is available. 

Usage Areas of Windows
The Windows operating system and its family are widely used. It is frequently used in the industrial field and mobile devices, especially in the IT sector. Different windows versions have been released according to needs and usage areas. 


-- Windows Filesystems --

What is File System?
A file system is a data structure that maintains the order of digital storage areas, and whose unit is a file. The operating system cannot make sense of the spaces on the disk without the file system. It cannot know which data group is on the disk as a file. So the file system is a very important component for running the operating system. File systems have different types and data structures. This data structure can be different for each file system

File Systems Used in Windows
File systems have also been developed, like every technology that has developed from the past to the present. With the development of technology, the need for new file systems has emerged due to increased processing power and storage capacity. Therefore, different file systems have been developed continuously and released to the market. Some of these file systems used in Windows operating systems are given below. 

1. FAT
The File Allocation Table (FAT) file system was developed and released for personal computers in 1977. Although the purpose of its emergence was to be used on floppy disks, it was adapted to be used in hard drives and other devices over time. The FAT file system is not the default file system for Microsoft Windows operating systems today. Today, it is used in USB flash drives, flash drives, and other embedded systems. 

2. exFAT
exFAT (Extensible File Allocation Table) is a file system introduced by Microsoft in 2006 and optimized for flash memory such as USB flash drives and SD cards. (Source: Wikipedia) 

3. NTFS
New Technology File System (NTFS) was announced and started to be used with the Windows NT 3.1 version in 1993. It was used as the default file system within the Windows operating system with this version and it still is. It replaced FAT file system as it is a more advanced file system that is suitable for new technologies. In addition, the NTFS file system also supports Linux and BSD systems. 

It is of great importance for SOC analysts to know the technical details of the NTFS file system considering that it is predominantly used in Windows operating systems as the latest technology today. Knowing the structure of the file system ensures that the security-oriented inferences to be obtained in the analyses are more and more consistent for analysts who perform host analysis. In order to have further information on this topic, detailed information can be obtained by conducting research under the name of "Filesystem Forensics". 


-- Directory Structure --

What is Directory Structure?
As in every operating system, the folder and file structure in Windows takes place in a certain order from the first installation. This order is determined by the company/person that developed the operating system. 
Although windows versions have similar folder structures in general, some folders and files may differ depending on the version of the operating system. The examples in this training are shown on the "Windows Server 2019 Datacenter". 
In Windows, the root directory is "drive:\", for example, the root directory is usually "C:\". The directory separator is usually a "\", but the operating system also internally recognizes a "/". Physical and virtual drives are named by a drive letter, as opposed to being combined as one.

Directories in Windows
The directory structure is created as follows when Windows is first installed. 
- PerfLogs
- Program Files
- Program Files (x86)
- ProgramData
- Users
- Windows

1. PerfLogs
It is the folder created to keep Windows performance logs. It is found as an empty folder because the logging option is turned off by default. 

2. ProgramData
The ProgramData folder is located as a hidden folder under the root of the disk where the Windows operating system is installed. The "Hidden Items" option must be activated under the "View" menu first to be able to see the folder. There are data belonging to the programs installed in the system, independent from the user accounts in this folder. 

3. Program Files
All the programs installed in the system are located under the "Program Files" folder in a Windows operating system installed as 32-bit. In Windows operating systems installed as 64-bit, only 64-bit programs are installed under this folder. 

4. Program Files (x86)
This folder is only available on Windows operating systems installed as "64-bit". There are programs installed on the system as "32-bit" under this folder. Programs installed as "64-bit" are stored in another folder named “Program Files” with a similar name.

5. Users
The Users folder contains the personal folder of each user who has logged on to the system at least once. Folders and documents such as desktop folder, downloaded files, and documents are stored under this folder that belongs to each user on the system. 

6. Windows
The Windows folder is where the entire operating system is installed. It has its own structure and it contains many systemic information in a certain order. For example, the database where users' passwords are kept is located under this folder. 


-- Windows Command Line --

What is the "Command Line"?
The command line is an intermediary program that receives the commands from the user via the keyboard and transfers them to the operating system for execution. 

- Basic Commands -
Basic Commands
In Windows, many operations can be done through the command line. Below are some commands that are basically used in the Windows operating system. 

1. "Help" Command
The "Help" is the command that provides detailed information about the commands used on the command line. We can see the parameters of the commands that we need to get information with the "Help" command. 

C:\Users\mirko>help dir
Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.

DIR [drive:][path][filename] [/A[[:]attributes]] [/B] [/C] [/D] [/L] [/N]
  [/O[[:]sortorder]] [/P] [/Q] [/R] [/S] [/T[[:]timefield]] [/W] [/X] [/4]

  [drive:][path][filename]
              Specifies drive, directory, and/or files to list.

  /A          Displays files with specified attributes.
  attributes   D  Directories                R  Read-only files
               H  Hidden files               A  Files ready for archiving
               S  System files               I  Not content indexed files
               L  Reparse Points             O  Offline files
               -  Prefix meaning not
  /B          Uses bare format (no heading information or summary).
  /C          Display the thousand separator in file sizes.  This is the
              default.  Use /-C to disable display of separator.
  /D          Same as wide but files are list sorted by column.
  /L          Uses lowercase.
  /N          New long list format where filenames are on the far right.
  /O          List by files in sorted order.
  sortorder    N  By name (alphabetic)       S  By size (smallest first)
               E  By extension (alphabetic)  D  By date/time (oldest first)
               G  Group directories first    -  Prefix to reverse order
  /P          Pauses after each screenful of information.
  /Q          Display the owner of the file.
  /R          Display alternate data streams of the file.
  /S          Displays files in specified directory and all subdirectories.
  /T          Controls which time field displayed or used for sorting
  timefield   C  Creation
              A  Last Access
              W  Last Written
  /W          Uses wide list format.
  /X          This displays the short names generated for non-8dot3 file
              names.  The format is that of /N with the short name inserted
              before the long name. If no short name is present, blanks are
              displayed in its place.
  /4          Displays four-digit years

Switches may be preset in the DIRCMD environment variable.  Override
preset switches by prefixing any switch with - (hyphen)--for example, /-W.

C:\Users\mirko>

2. "Dir" Command
The "Dir" is the command that lists the files and the folders under the current directory. For example, let's see the files and folders under "C:\Users\LetsDefend": 

3. "Cd" Command
The "Cd" is the command that is used for directory transitions. For example, let's switch from the "C:\Windows" directory to the "C:\Windows\system32" directory: 

4. "Date" Command
The "Date" is the command that is used to view and change the system's date information. For example, let's see the date information with the "date /t" command:

C:\Users\mirko>date /t
26.11.2024

5. "Echo" Command
The "Echo" is the command that is used to print to the screen. For example, let's print "BlueTeam" to the screen with the echo command: 

C:\Users\mirko>echo "Hi all there ;-)"
"Hi all there ;-)"

C:\Users\mirko>

6. "Hostname" Command
The "Hostname" is the command that is used to see the hostname information of the system.

C:\Users\mirko>hostname
cyberpunk

7. "Time" Command
The "Time" is the command that is used to see the system time. For example, let's see the system time with the command "time /t": 

C:\Users\mirko>time /t
20:38

- Network Commands -

1. "Ipconfig" Command
The "Ipconfig" is the command that allows viewing information about network interfaces on the system via the command line.
Note: In order to get detailed information about all network interfaces, the "ipconfig" command should be used with the "/all" parameter.

2. "Netstat" Command
It is possible to view the current network connections and their statuses via the netstat command. 

Note: Since the output of the netstat command is too long, only the first part is displayed in the above image.

- "-a" parameter : Displays all connections and listening ports.
- "-n" parameter : Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
- "-o" parameter : Displays the owning process ID associated with each connection.

3. "Nslookup" Command
Devices communicate with each other through numerical values in the IT world. Therefore, values that do not correspond to numerical values need to find their numerical equivalents. For example, when trying to access the "letsdefend.io" domain, the IP address of the target DNS server must be known or learned. In this case, an intermediary should perform a domain name and IP address resolution and report the IP address of the DNS server of the desired domain. It is the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol that carries out this task. There are some tools and commands used for this. For example, let's find the DNS server IP address of the "letsdefend.io" address with the "nslookup" tool: 

C:\Users\mirko>nslookup letsdefend.io
Server:  fritz.box
Address:  fd00::d624:ddff:fede:5fd

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    letsdefend.io
Addresses:  18.102.16.191
          35.152.119.144
          35.152.104.113


C:\Users\mirko>

4. "Ping" Command
It may be needed to test the network communication of two different devices within the same network. It is possible to find out whether the target is accessed with the "ping" command on the command line. Network packet(s) are sent to the destination and awaited for the response with the "ping" command. In this way, it can be tested whether there is network communication with the destination address. 

Note: As a security measure, the target system may be configured to not to respond to the "ping" command to prevent attackers from conducting network and host discovery. The examples below assume that this is not the case.

Note: "-n" parameter: Number of echo requests to send.

C:\Users\mirko>ping -n 5 google.com

Pinging google.com [2a00:1450:4001:828::200e] with 32 bytes of data:

C:\Users\mirko>

5. "Systeminfo" Command
The "Systeminfo" is the command that provides detailed information about the system.
Note : Since the output of the "systeminfo" command is too long, only the first part is displayed in the image.

- File Operations Commands -

File Operations Commands
This section covers commands for operations performed on files. 

1. "Type" Command
 The "type" is the command that is used to print the file content to the screen. 

C:\Users\mirko>type .bash_history
ls
pwd
cd
pwd
cd ..
pwd
cd ..
ls -l
clear
fsutil fsinfo drive
cleae
clear
fsutil fsinfo drives
pwd
mkdir metasploitable3-win2k8
rm metasploitable3-win2k8/
rm -rf metasploitable3-win2k8/
mkdir vagrantvms
cd vagrantvms/
mkdir metasploitable3-win2k8

2. "Copy" Command
The "copy" is the command that is used in file copy operations. The first parameter in the "copy" command is the path of the file to be copied. The second parameter is the target path. For example, let's copy the file "file.txt" with a copy in the same directory: 

C:\Users\mirko>type file.txt copyfile.txt

The image above shows that the file "file.txt" was successfully copied and a new file named "copyfile.txt" was created. 

3. "Mkdir" Command
The "mkdir" is the command that is used to create a new directory. It stands for "make directory". 

4. "Rename" Command
The "rename" is the command to rename files. For example, let's rename the file "file.txt" to "file2.txt": 

C:\Users\mirko>rename file.txt file2.txt

5. "Move" Command
The "move" is the command that is used to move files. For example, let's move the "file2.txt" file under the directory named "incident": 

C:\Users\mirko>move file.txt incident\

6. "Tree" Command
The "tree" is the command that allows listing nested directories with a single command. For example, let's list the folders under the "C:\Users\LetsDefend" directory: 

C:\Users\mirko>tree
Folder PATH listing for volume OS
Volume serial number is 44D2-A202

8. "Rmdir" Command
The "rmdir" is the command that is used to delete directories. For example, let's delete the directory named "incident": 
When "rmdir" command is run without parameters, directory deletion is not performed because the directory to be deleted must be empty in order for "rmdir" command to work without parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to use the command with a parameter. When the command is run, a warning will be prompted and if confirmed, the directory will be deleted. 

Note: "/S" parameter: Removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself. It is used to remove a directory tree.
We covered what the command line is, the importance of the command line in terms of security, and some of the basic commands in this part of the training. You can find other helpful commands and further detailed information on the Windows command line at the following addresses:

-- Windows Users and Groups --

About the Users and Groups
There are users and groups on the Windows operating system. The privileges and duties of users and groups on the system may differ. Attackers want to capture the most authorized user on the system. Therefore, the users and the groups they belong to are important from a security point of view. Attackers targeting Windows operating systems want to know what user privileges they have when they are able to send commands to the operating system because what they can do with a lower user profile may be limited. The attacker will attempt to attack back to increase the user authority after he/she figures out that he/she has access to the system with a low user profile. On the defensive side, what the analysts should do is to monitor user activities and detect anything suspicious within a short period of time.

"Whoami" Command
"whoami" is the command that shows which user account accessing the system.

C:\Users\mirko>whoami
cyberpunk\mirko

Note: The format in the whoami command output is "domain\username". If the host that’s making this search is not included in the domain, then the hostname information is displayed instead of the domain.

1. "net user" command
"net user" is the command that displays the usernames within the system. For example, let's see the usernames in the system by executing the command: 

C:\Users\mirko>net user

User accounts for \\CYBERPUNK

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest
mirko                    WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.

If detailed information is desired for a user in the system, a username should be given as a parameter to the "net user" command. For example, let's see the information of the user "Administrator": 

C:\Users\mirko>net user Administrator
User name                    Administrator
Full Name
Comment                      Built-in account for administering the computer/domain

Local Group Memberships      *Administrators
Global Group memberships     *None
The command completed successfully.

C:\Users\mirko>

2. "net accounts" command
"net accounts" command allows users to see the configurations related to password usage and logon restrictions on the system. For example, let's see the command by executing it: 

C:\Users\mirko>net accounts
Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          0
Maximum password age (days):                          42
Minimum password length:                              0
Length of password history maintained:                None
Lockout threshold:                                    10
Lockout duration (minutes):                           10

Computer role:                                        WORKSTATION
The command completed successfully.

C:\Users\mirko>

As seen in the image above, some configurations related to all of the users on the system have been successfully displayed on the screen. 

3. "net localgroup" command
"net localgroup" is the command that allows us to perform operations related to groups on the system. If it is used with parameters, different operations can be executed on groups. When used without parameters, it only displays the list of groups on the system. For example, let's see the groups on the system by executing the command without parameters: 

C:\Users\mirko>net localgroup

User and Group Management via Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- lusrmgr.msc
- gpedit.msc


-- Permissions Management on Windows --

Permissions Management on Windows
Permission management is one of the most important topics to ensure the overall operating system security. The system’s permissions management must be configured carefully. Each system has its own permissions management configuration. Windows has its own permissions management features as well. 

File and Folder Permissions
Each user has its own profile and permissions to prevent unauthorized access to files/folders. Normally, every file/folder gets its permissions from the parent folder in the Windows environment. This hierarchy continues up to the root directory of the hard drive. A user's ability to operate on a file is managed by the granted permissions. 

Viewing File permissions
File permissions operations can be performed via the Graphical User Interface (GUI) easily. For example, suppose we have a file named “file.txt” whose owner is the “LetsDefend” user. Let's right-click on the file and open the "properties" window and switch to the "security" tab
The file permissions have been successfully displayed. This “properties” window contains the list of users and groups and displays the permissions for the selected user/group. If the check mark indicating that the user is allowed for specific permissions types is grayed out, that means that this file inherits its permissions from another folder. If permissions are changed manually, then the checkmark will be in black color. 

Permissions Types
There are 6 different permissions types when managing file permissions: Full Control, Modify, Read&Execute, Read, Write, and Special permissions. The following table provides more information on the permissions types

Read*             
Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders
Permits viewing or accessing of the file's contents

Write*            
Permits adding of files and subfolders 
Permits writing to a file

Read & Execute*
Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files; inherited by files and folders 
Permits viewing and accessing of the file's contents as well as executing of the file

Modify*
Permits reading and writing of files and subfolders; allows deletion of the folder
Permits reading and writing of the file; allows deletion of the file

Full Control*
Permits reading, writing, changing, and deleting of files and subfolders
Permits reading, writing, changing and deleting of the file

Changing file permissions
Changing the file permissions requires one to be the owner of that file. For example, let's see who owns the file “file.txt”. Let’s right-click on the file and open the "properties" window, then click the "advanced" button in the "security" tab

The owner of the file is the "LetsDefend" user. Since we are logged into the system as the "LetsDefend" user, we can make changes on the permissions on this file.
Let's remove the "Read" permissions of the "LetsDefend" user to prevent his/her access to this file. In the security tab of the file’s properties window, let's select the "LetsDefend" user and make changes to the file permissions with the "Edit" button
We put a checkmark for the reading abilities of this user under the “deny” column that will ensure that the files will not be accessed by the “LetsDefend” user. 
Let's try to read the "file.txt" after making the changes as in the image above: 
When we tried to open the file, we receive an error message indicating that we don't have permission to access the file. Users without administrator privileges on the Windows environment are normally not able to access other directories that don’t belong to them. 
Let's try to read the "file.txt" after making the changes as in the image above: 
When we tried to open the file, we receive an error message indicating that we don't have permission to access the file. Users without administrator privileges on the Windows environment are normally not able to access other directories that don’t belong to them. For example, let's login to the "user2" account and try to access the directory of the "user1" account: 
As we see in the image above, we receive an error message indicating that we don't have permission to access to this folder. When we click on the "Continue" button to access, it requires us to login with the administrator credentials
Even if the user logs in with the administrator credentials he/she may still not be able to access the file without the read permissions on the file. 


User Account Control (UAC)

What is User Account Control (UAC)?
User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows operating systems to prevent unauthorized access. With this feature, certain changes and operations cannot be made without administrator permission. The error message for the administrator permission request in the example above is due to this feature. Although it increases the system security, this feature can be bypassed and violated by attackers from time to time. While it is not a good practice to rely only on this feature to ensure system security, it is also not a good practice not to use this feature. While performing security hardening of the system, "User Account Control" configurations should be applied carefully and correctly, like many other features. 

What is the difference among UAC levels in Windows?
We can access the UAC settings, see different levels, and make changes through the “Security and Maintenance” in the settings menu in the Windows operating system

UAC has 4 different levels: 
1. Always notify: At this level, you are notified before applications and users make changes that require administrative permissions. This is the most secure setting and the most annoying. 
2. Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (default): This is the default level, and UAC notifies you only before programs make changes that require administrative permissions. This is less secure than the first setting because malicious programs can be created to simulate the keystrokes or mouse movements made by a user and change Windows settings.
3. Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop): This level is identical to the previous setting except for the fact that, when a UAC prompt is shown, the desktop is not dimmed and other desktop apps can interfere with it. This level is even less secure as it makes it even easier for malicious programs to simulate keystrokes or mouse moves that interfere with the UAC prompt.
4. Never notify me: At this level, UAC is turned off, and it doesn't offer any protection against unauthorized system changes. If you don't have a good security suite you are very likely to encounter security issues with your Windows device. With UAC turned off it is much easier for malicious programs to infect Windows and take control.

What is Process?
A process is a program under execution in an active program. Processes are the units of commands/programs running on the operating system. Mainly the processes are examined during the live Windows host review. Examination and analysis of memory essentially actually mean the analysis of processes. Each process has its own identification number in the Windows environment which is called "Process ID" (PID) and they are logged in each process operation. 

Process Tree
Running a program is a process. From this process, another process can be created. There is a parent-child relationship between the two processes. 
Process: A process is a program under execution in an active program.
Parent Process: In computing, a parent process is a process that has created one or more child processes.
Child Process: A child process in computing is a process created by another process (the parent process). A parent process may have multiple child processes, but a child process only one parent process.

The hierarchical representation of parent processes and child processes is called the "Process Tree". There are some useful tools available for viewing the Process Tree. "Process Hacker" is one of the many of them. Process hacker is a free and open source tool. With this tool, all processes running in the Windows operating system can be monitored in real-time. The "Process Hacker" tool can be downloaded from: 
The "Process Hacker" tool displays the processes in Windows in hierarchical order. 

As seen for example "explorer.exe" is the parent process with the following 3 child processes: 
- Tvnserver.exe
- ProcessHacker.exe
- SnippingTool.exe

Although all of these processes are totally different processes, there is a parent-child relationship between all these. In this window, it is clearly seen that there are processes with or without child processes and even some with no child processes.

Windows Legitimate Processes
There are many Windows native processes with different tasks. Let’s see some of the important processes from a security point of view due to their current authorizations, and the user and system information they contain. 

wininit.exe
The “wininit.exe” process is known as the “Windows Initilization Process”. It is responsible for starting the Service Control Manager (services.exe), Local Security Authority process (lsass.exe), and Local Session Manager (lsm.exe). It is located under the “C:\Windows\System32” folder. It is created during system boot. It is the process that works with the privileges of the most authorized user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) on the system. 

services.exe
The “services.exe” is the process responsible for starting and stopping services. “Svchost.exe”, “dllhost.exe”, “taskhost.exe”, and “spoolsv.exe” are child processes of the “Services.exe” process. It is located under the “C:\Windows\System32” folder. It is the process that works with the privileges of the most authorized user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) on the system. There should only be 1 "services.exe" process at a time in the process tree under normal conditions. If there are multiple "services.exe" processes or if there is a process with a similar name, it should be investigated further as it may be a process that belongs to a malicious activity. 

svchost.exe
“Svchost.exe” is a generic host process name for services that run from dynamic-link libraries. Because DLL files are non-executable files, they are run with svchost for triggering the services of the operating system. “svchost.exe” is responsible for the usage and management of multi-dll services for the optimization of system sources. All DLL-based services share the same svchost process. Every svchost process occurs with executing unique services. It's parent process is “services.exe”. And "Services.exe" is the child process of "wininit.exe". 
“Svchost.exe” is located under the “C:\Windows\System32” folder. This is the process running on the system with “NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE” or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” privileges.

lsass.exe
The “lsass.exe” (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is the process responsible for critical security operations such as confirming or rejecting users' passwords during login in the Windows operating system. In addition, this process works actively during the password changes of users. This process is critically important as it contains the user passwords in the system. The attacker gaining access to the system can obtain the user's password by leveraging this process. There is a free tool called “mimikatz” developed by “Benjamin Delpy” and users' passwords can be obtained from the "lsass.exe" process with the help of the “Mimikatz” tool. It can be accessed at the following address: 
“lsass.exe” is located under the “C:\Windows\System32” folder. It is the process that works with the privileges of the most authorized user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) on the system.

winlogon.exe
The “Winlogon.exe” is the process that performs the login and logout operations of the users in the Windows operating system. It is the process that works with the privileges of the most authorized user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) on the system. “Winlogon.exe” is located under the “C:\Windows\System32” folder. 

explorer.exe
The “Explorer.exe” process is the parent process of almost every process that has a graphical user interface (GUI) in the Windows operating system and opens as a window. For example, this process kicks in when Windows explorer is started. Under normal circumstances, one "explorer.exe" process is expected. “Explorer.exe” is located under the “C:\Windows\” folder. This process runs with the privileges of the user who is currently logged in to the system. 

Task Manager
“Task Manager" is the application that enables to see and manage the processes on Windows operating system. The processes can be viewed and terminated with the help of the “Task Manager”. It has a graphical user interface (GUI)
The "processes" tab of the task manager application provides limited and general information about processes. Detailed information about the processes can be viewed under the "details" tab. 

Process Operations Commands
Windows process operations are generally performed via the Graphical User Interface (GUI). In some exceptional cases, we may need to perform process operations via the command line. Let’s see some of the important commands that we may need to use for various tasks: 

Tasklist command
The "Tasklist" command allows us to see the list of processes running on the system.

As seen in the screenshot above, the "Tasklist" command helps us display the information of the running processes on the system. 

taskkill command
The "Taskkill" is the command used to terminate the processes running in the system. In order to execute this command, the “PID (Process ID)” value of the process to be terminated must be known. The PID value is a numerical identification value given to the processes by the system in order to distinguish the processes from each other. For example, let's see the PID value of the "osk.exe (screen keyboard)" process we want to terminate: 

C:\Users\mirko>tasklist | findstr OpenConsole.exe
OpenConsole.exe              33492 Console                    3     14.616 K

C:\Users\mirko>

As seen in the image above, the PID value of the "OpenConsole.exe" process is seen as "33492". 

Note: The Pipe(|) sign allows you to give the output of one command as an input to another command. The “findstr” command (string search) is the command used in searches. Let's give the PID value as a parameter to the "taskkill" command and end the process:

Terminate the process named “OpenConsole.exe” with a PID value of 33492 with the “taskkill /PID 33492” command. 

C:\Users\mirko>taskkill /PID 33492


-- Windows Services --

What are Services?
Services are programs that have their own processes running in the background on Windows. Services can run without interacting with the user and needing to open a window on the screen. Each service has its own reason for running. As the system has its own services, there may also be services belonging to the programs installed later in the system. Services running on Windows are important from the security aspect. Attackers can gather information about the system through running services or use services to infiltrate the system. If there is an incident or suspicious activity, the SOC analysts should monitor the processes of all services, including the services added to the system through the event logs to be able to detect any suspicious activities. A newly created service with a potentially suspicious name may indicate an attacker's activity. In this part of the training, we will cover the Windows services.

Note: Event logs will be explained in the following parts of the training. 

- Managing Windows Services with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) -

Windows + R + services.msc
The status of the services can be seen and the services can be started and stopped
The "Path to executable" section contains the command that will run after the service is activated. This command may have essential hints about the attacker.

- Managing Windows Services with Command Line -

Manage Windows services from the command line: sc
Display all running services: sc query
View all services: sc query type=service state=all
Get information about the service: sc query wuauserv
Starting and Stopping the Service: sc start wuauserv | sc stop wuauserv

The most important thing we should pay attention here is that the command line must be opened with administrator privileges before executing the service stop command. If the command line is not opened with administrator privileges, the service stop command will not work and will result in an authorization error
