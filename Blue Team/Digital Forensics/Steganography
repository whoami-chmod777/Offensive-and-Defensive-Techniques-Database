"The practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data." An example of this would be having a text file that contains secret information, which is hidden inside an innocent image file. If this image file was sent as an email attachment, the recipient would receive a normal image file. However, using the right tools, you can recover the hidden file.
