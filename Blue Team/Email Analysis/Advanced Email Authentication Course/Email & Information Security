-- Zero Trust Security Model --

Zero trust security is a new IT security concept that’s essentially the opposite of the “trust but verify” approach. In a Zero Trust security model, you don’t trust anyone or anything by default and instead verify everything. This means that you need to establish identity and validate each user, device, and application before granting access to your network.
