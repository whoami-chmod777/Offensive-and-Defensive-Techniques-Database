This cheat sheet outlines tips and tools for analyzing malicious documents, such as Microsoft Office, RTF and Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files


-- General Approach to Document Analysis --

1. Examine the document for anomalies, such as risky tags, scripts, or other anomalous aspects.
2. Locate embedded code, such as shellcode, VBA macros, JavaScript or other suspicious objects.
3. Extract suspicious code or object from the file.
4. If relevant, deobfuscate and examine JavaScript or macro code.
5. If relevant, disassemble and/or debug shellcode.
6. Understand the next steps in the infection chain.


-- Microsoft Office Format Notes --

- Binary document files supported by Microsoft Office use the OLE2 (a.k.a. Structured Storage) format.
- SRP streams in OLE2 documents sometimes store a cached version of earlier macro code.
- OOXML documents (.docx, .xlsm, etc.) supported by MS Office use zip compression to store contents.
- Macros embedded in OOXML files are stored inside the OLE2 binary file, which is within the zip archive.
- RTF documents donâ€™t support macros, but can contain other files embedded as OLE1 objects.
