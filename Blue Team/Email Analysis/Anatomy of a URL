Understanding the anatomy of a URL is critical for threat detection, incident analysis, and forensic investigations. Malicious actors often manipulate URLs to deliver phishing attacks, malware, or redirect users to malicious sites.

Anatomy of the URL for Analysis

https://login.bank-security.com/login/validate.php?user=jdoe&session=abcd1234


- Protocol (https://): Specifies the communication protocol (e.g., HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, SFTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, TELNET).
- Subdomain (login): Specifies a specific section of a domain, often used for different services (e.g., login for authentication).   
- Domain (bank-security): Identifies the core domain name.
- Top-Level Domain (TLD) (.com): The highest level of a domain name (e.g., .com, .org, .net).    
- Subdirectory (/login/): Specifies a directory or folder within the domain.
- File (validate.php): Specifies the file being accessed, often a script like .php or .html.
- Parameters (Query String) (?user=jdoe&session=abcd1234): Contains data sent to the server, such as user information or session IDs.


-- How to Use this Information --

1. Phishing Detection: Malicious actors often manipulate domains and subdomains to create legitimate-looking URLs. Analyze these elements for typo-squatting or fake login pages.
2. Malware Delivery: Attackers may hide malware behind files with deceptive names or extensions. By dissecting the file part of the URL, can detect harmful downloads.
3. Credential Theft: URLs with parameters like ?user=admin&password=1234 may expose sensitive information or be part of a malicious script to steal credentials.
4. Incident Response: Use URL analysis to track the flow of an attack, identify its origin, and block malicious domains or paths from further compromising the network.
