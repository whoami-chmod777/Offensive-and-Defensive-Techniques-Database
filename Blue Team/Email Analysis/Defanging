"Defanging" a URL or "URL obfuscation" is a common technique used to make URLs non-clickable or inactive in order to prevent users from accidentally clicking on potentially malicious links. By altering the URL, such as changing www.example.com to www[.]example[.]com, the link is no longer functional, reducing the risk of accidentally visiting a harmful website while still allowing the recipient to recognize the original URL.


1. Using a Command Line Script (Python)

import re

def defang_url(text):
    # Replace dots (.) with [.] and colons (:) with [:]
    defanged_text = re.sub(r'\.', '[.]', text)
    defanged_text = re.sub(r':', '[:]', defanged_text)
    return defanged_text

# Example usage
url = "https://www.example.com/path?query=value"
print(defang_url(url))


How to Run:

- Copy and paste the script into a Python file (e.g., defang.py).
- Run the script by typing python defang.py in the command line.

This will replace all periods (.) and colons (:) with [.] and [:] to defang the URL.


2. Using an Online Tool (Website):

There are also online tools that allow you to defang URLs automatically:

Defang.me: A simple online tool where you can paste a URL, and it will defang it by replacing the periods and colons with [.] and [:].

Steps:
- Go to Defang.me.
- Paste your URL into the box.
- Click "Defang."
- Copy the defanged URL from the output.

https://defang.me/


3. Using sed Command (Linux/macOS):

You can use the sed command in Linux/macOS to replace characters in a URL to defang it.

Example Command:
echo "https://www.example.com" | sed 's/\./[.]/g' | sed 's/:/[;]/g'

This will defang the URL by replacing periods (.) with [.] and colons (:) with [;].
