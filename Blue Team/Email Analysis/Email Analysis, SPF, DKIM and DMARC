-- Step-by-Step Email Analysis for Malicious Indicators --

We'll analyze the email headers to determine whether it's malicious or safe. 

Step 1: Identify the Source of the Email

Received: The email originated from mail-pf1-f178.google.com (IP: 209.85.210.178).
Sending Email Server: Google‚Äôs mail server (Gmail).

Authentication Results:
‚Ä¢ SPF: ‚úÖ PASS (Sender Policy Framework) ‚Äì The sender IP is authorized to send emails from Gmail.
‚Ä¢ DKIM: ‚úÖ PASS (DomainKeys Identified Mail) ‚Äì The email signature was verified, ensuring it wasn‚Äôt tampered with.
‚Ä¢ DMARC: ‚úÖ PASS ‚Äì Domain-based authentication passed, confirming alignment with SPF and DKIM.

‚úÖ Conclusion: Since SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all passed, this email is likely legitimate. However, further checks are needed.

Step 2: Check the Email Path (Routing)
‚Ä¢ First Received: The email was first received by mail-pf1-f178.google.com (Google‚Äôs mail server).
‚Ä¢ Second Received: It passed through DM6NAM04FT046.mail.protection.outlook.com (Microsoft‚Äôs mail protection service).
‚Ä¢ Final Received: It reached DS7PR03CA0352.outlook.office365.com, a Microsoft Office 365 server.

‚úÖ Conclusion: The email followed a legitimate path through Google and Microsoft servers, indicating a valid relay.

Step 3: Verify the Sender‚Äôs IP Address
‚Ä¢ Sender IP: 209.85.210.178
‚Ä¢ Reverse DNS Lookup: mail-pf1-f178.google.com (a valid Google mail server)

‚úÖ Conclusion: The sender IP is a Google-owned mail server, which is legitimate.

Step 4: Check for Email Spoofing
‚Ä¢ Since the authentication mechanisms (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) all passed, email spoofing is unlikely.

‚úÖ Conclusion: No signs of spoofing.

Step 5: Inspect the DKIM Signature

The DKIM-Signature and Google DKIM Signature verify that:
‚Ä¢ The email originated from Gmail.
‚Ä¢ It was not altered in transit.

‚úÖ Conclusion: The signature is valid, ensuring email integrity.

Step 6: Look for Malicious Content Indicators
‚Ä¢ No attachments (.exe, .zip, .docm) are visible in the header.
‚Ä¢ No suspicious URLs or payloads in the headers.
‚Ä¢ No urgency-based keywords (e.g., "Your account is hacked," "Urgent action required").

‚úÖ Conclusion: No obvious malicious content.

Final Verdict: Is the Email Malicious?

‚ùå Not Malicious
‚Ä¢ SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all pass.
‚Ä¢ The sender's IP is a legitimate Google mail server.
‚Ä¢ The routing path is valid.
‚Ä¢ No signs of spoofing or tampering.
‚Ä¢ No attachments or phishing indicators in the header.

Next Steps (If Suspicious)

If you suspect an email despite these checks, you should:
‚Ä¢ Analyze the email body ‚Äì Look for phishing links or fake login pages.
‚Ä¢ Check the links ‚Äì Use tools like VirusTotal to scan embedded URLs.
‚Ä¢ Investigate attachments ‚Äì If the email has attachments, scan them with antivirus software.

Alright! Let's go step by step and properly analyze an email header to determine if it's legitimate or malicious. I'll explain what to look for, what tools to use, and how to interpret the data.


-- Step-by-Step Email Header Analysis --

üîç Step-by-Step Email Header Analysis

1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract the Email Header
If you receive a suspicious email, you need to access the email header.

How to get email headers:
‚Ä¢ Gmail: Open the email ‚Üí Click More (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí Show Original.
‚Ä¢ Outlook: Open email ‚Üí Click File ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Internet headers.
‚Ä¢ Yahoo: Open email ‚Üí Click More ‚Üí View Raw Message.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the "Received" Chain (Email Routing Path)

The "Received" headers show the path the email took to reach your inbox. It lists all the mail servers the email passed through.

Example Header:
Received: from mail-xyz.google.com (209.85.220.65)
by mx-outlook.office365.com (Microsoft SMTP Server) with TLS;
Mon, 12 Mar 2024 14:23:45 +0000

What to check:
‚úÖ Legitimate: The email should be coming from the expected mail server (e.g., Gmail emails should be from google.com, Microsoft emails from outlook.com).
‚ùå Suspicious: If an email claims to be from Gmail but originates from a random IP (194.25.77.10), it might be spoofed.
üõ† Tools to verify sender IP:

‚Ä¢ Check IP location: MXToolbox or Whois lookup
‚Ä¢ Reverse DNS lookup: nslookup 209.85.220.65 (on command line)

üîπ If the IP is from an unusual country or not from an official mail server, the email may be spoofed.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

Authentication-Results: spf=pass (sender IP is 209.85.220.65)
smtp.mailfrom=gmail.com

‚úÖ PASS: The sender is allowed to send emails on behalf of gmail.com.
‚ùå FAIL: The email could be spoofed or sent from an unauthorized server.

üõ† Check SPF records:
Run: nslookup -type=TXT gmail.com
If the sender‚Äôs IP isn‚Äôt listed in the SPF record, the email is likely fake.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=gmail.com; s=20221208;
bh=Ibt9W0ycqnYsdG1dbipaHiMcrWiKUcXGaaUCR2z8YSI=;

‚úÖ PASS: The email's digital signature is valid.
‚ùå FAIL: The email might have been altered during transmission.

üõ† Check DKIM manually:
Run: nslookup -type=TXT google._domainkey.gmail.com
If the public key doesn't match, the email is suspicious.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Check DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

Authentication-Results: dmarc=pass (header.from=gmail.com)

‚úÖ PASS: Email passes SPF and DKIM alignment.
‚ùå FAIL: The email might be spoofed.

üõ† Check DMARC manually:
Run: nslookup -type=TXT _dmarc.gmail.com
If the result is missing or shows a strict rejection (p=reject), the domain owner is enforcing DMARC.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Examine the "Reply-To" Field for Email Spoofing

From: "PayPal Support" <support@paypal.com>
Reply-To: "Scammer" <hacker@randommail.com>

‚úÖ Legitimate: "From" and "Reply-To" should be from the same domain.
‚ùå Suspicious: If the "Reply-To" is different (e.g., a personal email instead of a company address), it may be a phishing email.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Look for Spoofing Signs in the "Message-ID"

Message-ID: <CAHE6t77-1234aBCD@google.com>

‚úÖ Google emails should have @google.com
‚ùå If it has @randomdomain.com but claims to be from Google, it may be fake.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Scan for Links or Attachments

‚Ä¢ Check for phishing links inside the email body (not in the header).
‚Ä¢ Use VirusTotal or URLScan.io to check suspicious links.
‚Ä¢ Be cautious of attachments like .exe, .docm, or .zip files.


-- Real-World Email Analysis Example --

üîé Real-World Email Analysis Example

Let's analyze an actual malicious email header:

Received: from attacker-mail.xyz (194.25.77.10) by mail.google.com
Authentication-Results: spf=fail smtp.mailfrom=paypal.com
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=paypal.com; bh=fakevalue=
Reply-To: scammer@randommail.com
Message-ID: <123abc@attackersite.com>

üî¥ Red Flags Found:
‚ùå The email claims to be from paypal.com but originates from an unknown server (194.25.77.10).
‚ùå SPF failed ‚Äì paypal.com does not authorize this sender.
‚ùå Reply-To is different from the claimed sender.
‚ùå DKIM signature doesn‚Äôt match.

‚úÖ Final Verdict: This email is a phishing attempt!

üõ† Useful Tools for Email Header Analysis

‚Ä¢ MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer: mxtoolbox.com
‚Ä¢ IP Lookup & Whois: who.is
‚Ä¢ SPF/DKIM/DMARC Verification: nslookup commands or DMARC Analyzer
‚Ä¢ Phishing Link Scanner: VirusTotal, URLScan

üí° Summary
‚Ä¢ Check "Received" Headers ‚Äì Validate the email's journey.
‚Ä¢ Verify SPF ‚Äì Ensure the sender is authorized.
‚Ä¢ Check DKIM Signature ‚Äì Confirm the email wasn‚Äôt altered.
‚Ä¢ Validate DMARC ‚Äì Ensure the domain has strict email security.
‚Ä¢ Look for Spoofing Signs ‚Äì Compare "From" vs. "Reply-To".
‚Ä¢ Scan Attachments & Links ‚Äì Avoid clicking on suspicious URLs.

üîπ If SPF, DKIM, and DMARC fail, or if the sender IP is suspicious, the email is likely phishing or spam. üö®


-- Analyzing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC --

When analyzing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, the order matters depending on how email authentication works.

Which Order to Follow?

The best practice is to analyze them from the bottom up in the email header. That means:
1Ô∏è‚É£ DMARC
2Ô∏è‚É£ DKIM
3Ô∏è‚É£ SPF

Why? Because DMARC depends on SPF and DKIM to determine whether an email is legitimate.

Step-by-Step Email Header Analysis: Bottom to Top

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with DMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
üìç DMARC is the final verdict that checks whether SPF and DKIM are aligned.

Example in the header: 
Authentication-Results: dmarc=pass action=none header.from=gmail.com;

‚úÖ Pass: DMARC confirms SPF or DKIM matched the domain policy.
‚ùå Fail: The email fails SPF and DKIM alignment ‚Üí Possible phishing attempt.

üîç What to check?
Look for p=quarantine or p=reject in the domain‚Äôs DMARC policy.
Run nslookup -type=TXT _dmarc.gmail.com to see Gmail's DMARC policy.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, Check DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
üìç DKIM ensures that the email was not altered during transmission.

Example in the header:
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=gmail.com; s=20221208;
bh=Ibt9W0ycqnYsdG1dbipaHiMcrWiKUcXGaaUCR2z8YSI=

‚úÖ Pass: DKIM signature is valid, proving the email was sent from an authorized Gmail server.
‚ùå Fail: DKIM could not verify the digital signature ‚Üí Possible tampering.

üîç What to check?
‚Ä¢ Look at the d= field (domain). If it‚Äôs different from From: (e.g., d=fake-domain.com but From=gmail.com), it‚Äôs suspicious.
‚Ä¢ Run nslookup -type=TXT google._domainkey.gmail.com to verify the DKIM record.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, Check SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
üìç SPF ensures that the email was sent from an authorized server.

Example in the header:
Received-SPF: Pass (protection.outlook.com: domain of gmail.com designates
209.85.210.178 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com;
client-ip=209.85.210.178;

‚úÖ Pass: The email was sent from an IP authorized by Gmail.
‚ùå Fail: The sending IP is not listed in Gmail's SPF records ‚Üí Possible spoofing.

üîç What to check?
‚Ä¢ Extract the client-ip= and verify it belongs to the domain (gmail.com).
‚Ä¢ Run nslookup -type=TXT gmail.com to see the SPF record.

üí° Summary: Why Check from Bottom to Top?

‚Ä¢ DMARC is the final decision-maker, so you start there.
‚Ä¢ DKIM ensures the email is unchanged, which is critical for DMARC.
‚Ä¢ SPF only verifies the sending server, which is useful but not always enough.

üöÄ Best Practice: DMARC ‚Üí DKIM ‚Üí SPF
This order ensures a complete, accurate analysis.


-- Analyze SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Using dig --

dig (Domain Information Groper) is a powerful command-line tool for querying DNS records, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Below, I'll show how to use dig to analyze these authentication mechanisms.

üîç Step-by-Step SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Analysis Using dig

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

Command: dig TXT gmail.com +short

‚Ä¢ Look for a record that starts with "v=spf1"

Example output: "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"

If the sending IP is not listed in the SPF record, it means the email may be spoofed.

Verify the SPF Include Domains

If the SPF record includes another domain (_spf.google.com), you need to dig deeper: dig TXT _spf.google.com +short

Example output: "v=spf1 ip4:64.233.160.0/19 ip4:66.249.80.0/20 ~all"

Compare the sending IP with the allowed IP ranges.

‚úÖ SPF Pass: If the sending IP is in the list.
‚ùå SPF Fail: If the sending IP is missing ‚Üí possible spoofing.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Check DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM records are stored under a selector in the format:

<selector>._domainkey.<domain>

Command: dig TXT 20221208._domainkey.gmail.com +short

(Replace 20221208 with the DKIM selector from the email header.)

Example output: "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4..."

This record contains the public key used to verify the DKIM signature.

‚úÖ DKIM Pass: If the public key in this record matches the DKIM signature in the email header.
‚ùå DKIM Fail: If no record exists or the key doesn't match ‚Üí possible tampering.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

Command: dig TXT _dmarc.gmail.com +short

Example output: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@google.com"

The key part is p=, which defines the DMARC policy:

‚Ä¢ p=none ‚Üí Just monitors (not strict).
‚Ä¢ p=quarantine ‚Üí Suspicious emails go to spam.
‚Ä¢ p=reject ‚Üí Emails failing SPF/DKIM are blocked.

‚úÖ DMARC Pass: If SPF or DKIM aligns with the From domain.
‚ùå DMARC Fail: If alignment fails, and p=reject, the email may be blocked.


-- Example Full Analysis Using -- 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check SPF:

dig TXT paypal.com +short

Result: "v=spf1 include:_spf.paypal.com -all"

üîç Now, check _spf.paypal.com:

dig TXT _spf.paypal.com +short

Result: "v=spf1 ip4:192.168.1.1 ip4:192.168.2.2 -all"

‚úÖ If the sending IP is in this list ‚Üí SPF Pass.
‚ùå If not ‚Üí SPF Fail.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check DKIM:

Find the DKIM selector from the email header (s=selector), then run:

dig TXT selector._domainkey.paypal.com +short

Result: "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0G..."

‚úÖ If this matches the DKIM signature in the email header ‚Üí DKIM Pass.
‚ùå If it doesn‚Äôt match ‚Üí DKIM Fail.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check DMARC:

dig TXT _dmarc.paypal.com +short

Result: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@paypal.com"

‚úÖ If SPF or DKIM passes ‚Üí DMARC Pass.
‚ùå If neither passes and p=reject ‚Üí The email should be rejected.

-- About dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt futurepipe.com --

dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt futurepipe.com

Is used to query TXT records of futurepipe.com using Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8). Let's break it down:

üîç What Each Part Means?

dig ‚Üí Calls the Domain Information Groper tool.
@8.8.8.8 ‚Üí Uses Google Public DNS as the resolver.
-t txt ‚Üí Queries TXT (text) records, which can include:
‚Ä¢ SPF (Sender Policy Framework) ‚Üí Email security rule.
‚Ä¢ DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) ‚Üí Email authentication policy.
‚Ä¢ Other TXT records (like verification records for Google, Microsoft, etc.).
futurepipe.com ‚Üí The domain you are querying.

üîç Expected Output

When running: dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt futurepipe.com

You may see output like this:
;; ANSWER SECTION:
futurepipe.com.  3600  IN  TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.protection.outlook.com -all"
futurepipe.com.  3600  IN  TXT "google-site-verification=abcdefg12345"
futurepipe.com.  3600  IN  TXT "MS=ms123456789"

üîé How to Interpret the Output?

SPF Record (v=spf1 ...)
‚Ä¢ "v=spf1 include:_spf.protection.outlook.com -all"
‚Ä¢ What this means: The domain only allows Outlook mail servers to send emails on its behalf.
‚Ä¢ How to verify an email? If an email claims to be from futurepipe.com, but is not sent from Outlook servers, then it fails SPF (possible spoofing attempt).

Google Site Verification (google-site-verification=...)
‚Ä¢ What this means: This is just a Google Search Console verification record.
‚Ä¢ Does it affect emails? ‚ùå No.

Microsoft Verification (MS=...)
‚Ä¢ What this means: Microsoft Office 365 domain verification.
‚Ä¢ Does it affect emails? ‚ùå No.

üîé Additional Queries You Can Run

‚úÖ Check SPF More Deeply

Since the SPF record references _spf.protection.outlook.com, you should expand it: dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt _spf.protection.outlook.com

This will return the list of allowed IPs for sending emails.

‚úÖ Check DMARC

dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt _dmarc.futurepipe.com

If it returns something like: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@futurepipe.com"

‚Ä¢ This means strict DMARC enforcement (rejects unauthorized emails).
‚Ä¢ If no DMARC record exists, the domain is less protected against phishing.

‚úÖ Check DKIM (If Selector is Known)

dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt selector._domainkey.futurepipe.com

‚Ä¢ Replace selector with the correct DKIM selector from the email header.
‚Ä¢ If no record exists, DKIM is not enabled.

üöÄ Final Summary
‚úÖ Command	                                                ‚úÖ Purpose

‚Ä¢ dig ‚Üí Domain Information Groper, used for querying DNS.
‚Ä¢ @8.8.8.8 ‚Üí Uses Google Public DNS to resolve the domain.
‚Ä¢ -t txt ‚Üí Queries TXT records, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
‚Ä¢ futurepipe.com ‚Üí The domain being checked.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Interpreting the Results

Your ANSWER SECTION contains multiple TXT records for futurepipe.com. Let‚Äôs break them down.
üîç SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Record

SPF record found: "v=spf1 ip4:213.42.27.114 ip4:61.16.143.130 ip4:196.204.140.6 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:eu._netblocks.mimecast.com include:spf.zoho.com include:transmail.net include:zoho.com -all"

üõ† What This Means

‚úÖ Authorized IPs:
‚Ä¢ 213.42.27.114
‚Ä¢ 61.16.143.130
‚Ä¢ 196.204.140.6

‚úÖ Includes additional authorized mail services:
‚Ä¢ spf.protection.outlook.com (Microsoft email services)
‚Ä¢ eu._netblocks.mimecast.com (Mimecast security)
‚Ä¢ spf.zoho.com, transmail.net, zoho.com (Zoho email services)

‚úÖ Strict SPF Policy (-all)
‚Ä¢ The -all at the end means only these IPs and mail servers can send emails on behalf of futurepipe.com.
‚Ä¢ Any other sender will fail SPF checks.

Verdict: ‚úÖ Strong SPF setup!

üîç Google Verification TXT Records

These records are used for Google Search Console verification, not email security:

"google-site-verification=fMuqKiFaO..."
"google-site-verification=k4YLBJLWE..."
"google-site-verification=JtYQzP6..."

‚úÖ These are normal and unrelated to SPF/DKIM/DMARC.

üîç Microsoft Verification Record

"MS=ms30486720"

‚úÖ This is for Microsoft domain verification (Office 365, Azure, etc.).
‚úÖ Not related to email authentication.

üîç DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

No DKIM record is visible in this query.
To check DKIM, you need the DKIM selector from an actual email header.

‚úÖ To manually check DKIM, use:

dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt selector._domainkey.futurepipe.com

(Replace selector with the correct DKIM selector from the email header.)

üîç DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

Your output does not show a DMARC record.

‚úÖ To check DMARC, run:

dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt _dmarc.futurepipe.com

If DMARC is missing, it means futurepipe.com does not enforce DMARC protection.

If present, it should have a policy like: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@futurepipe.com"

‚Ä¢ p=none ‚Üí Just monitors.
‚Ä¢ p=quarantine ‚Üí Suspicious emails go to spam.
‚Ä¢ p=reject ‚Üí Blocks unauthorized emails.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Errors in the Terminal Output

The command: v=spf1 ip4:213.42.27.114 ...

resulted in: command not found

This is because the user mistakenly typed part of the SPF record as a command instead of running dig again.

‚úÖ To properly expand SPF includes, use:

dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt _spf.protection.outlook.com
dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt eu._netblocks.mimecast.com
dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt spf.zoho.com

These will show the IP ranges allowed for each included service.

üîç Final Analysis
Check	                  Status	              Verdict
‚úÖ SPF	                Found	                Strong, strict -all
‚ùå DKIM	                Not found in query	  Needs manual check with selector

‚úÖ Verification TXT	    Found	                Google & Microsoft verified

üö® Recommendations

Check DKIM with the correct selector: dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt selector._domainkey.futurepipe.com
Check if DMARC is configured: dig @8.8.8.8 -t txt _dmarc.futurepipe.com

If DMARC is missing, configure it to p=reject for better security.


-- Quarantine, Spam, and Received Emails --

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC in the Context of Quarantine, Spam, and Received Emails
When an email is sent, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work together to validate the authenticity of the sender. If any of these checks fail, the receiving mail server may quarantine the email, mark it as spam, or reject it completely.

1Ô∏è‚É£ SPF (Sender Policy Framework) in Email Filtering

Purpose: SPF ensures that the email comes from an authorized mail server for the sender's domain.
How It Works

‚Ä¢ The receiving server checks if the sender's IP matches the SPF record of the sending domain.
‚Ä¢ If the IP is allowed, the email passes SPF.
‚Ä¢ If the IP is not listed, the SPF fails.

Impact on Email Delivery

SPF Result	              Effect on Email
‚úÖ SPF Pass	              The email is delivered normally.
‚ö† SPF SoftFail (~all)	  The email may be marked as spam or quarantined.
‚ùå SPF Fail (-all)	      The email is rejected or sent to spam/quarantine.

Example SPF Fail in Email Headers

Received-SPF: Fail (domain.com: 203.0.113.10 is not allowed to send mail)

‚Ä¢ If DMARC is set to p=reject, the email gets rejected.
‚Ä¢ If DMARC is set to p=quarantine, the email goes to spam.

2Ô∏è‚É£ DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) in Email Filtering

Purpose: DKIM ensures that the email was not altered in transit by verifying a digital cryptographic signature.

How It Works

‚Ä¢ The sending server signs the email with a private key.
‚Ä¢ The receiving server checks the DKIM signature using the public key in the DNS record.

Impact on Email Delivery

DKIM Result	      Effect on Email
‚úÖ DKIM Pass	    Email is trusted and delivered normally.
‚ùå DKIM Fail	    The email may be marked as spam or rejected depending on DMARC policy.

Example DKIM Fail in Email Headers

Authentication-Results: dkim=fail (signature verification failed)

‚Ä¢ If DMARC is strict (p=reject), the email is blocked.
‚Ä¢ If DMARC is relaxed (p=quarantine), the email goes to spam.

3Ô∏è‚É£ DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) in Email Filtering

Purpose: DMARC enforces SPF and DKIM and provides instructions on what to do when they fail.
How It Works

‚Ä¢ The receiving server checks if the email aligns with SPF or DKIM.
‚Ä¢ If neither SPF nor DKIM pass, the DMARC policy (p=none, p=quarantine, or p=reject) decides the action.

DMARC Policy and Its Effect

DMARC Policy	  Effect on Email
p=none	        Email is delivered normally, even if SPF/DKIM fail (only reports failures).
p=quarantine	  The email goes to spam/junk if SPF and DKIM fail.
p=reject	      The email is blocked and not delivered.

Example DMARC Record: "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@domain.com"

‚Ä¢ If SPF or DKIM passes, email is delivered normally.
‚Ä¢ If both fail, the email is sent to spam/junk.

Example DMARC Fail in Email Headers: Authentication-Results: dmarc=fail (policy=reject)

‚Ä¢ If p=reject, the email is blocked.
‚Ä¢ If p=quarantine, the email is delivered but lands in spam.

4Ô∏è‚É£ How These Affect Received Emails

When you receive an email, it will pass through SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. The results determine where the email lands:

SPF	      DKIM	    DMARC	              Result in Email Inbox
‚úÖ Pass	  ‚úÖ Pass	  ‚úÖ Pass	            üì© Delivered normally
‚úÖ Pass	  ‚ùå Fail	  ‚úÖ Pass	            üì© Delivered normally
‚ùå Fail	  ‚úÖ Pass	  ‚úÖ Pass	            üì© Delivered normally
‚ùå Fail	  ‚ùå Fail	  ‚úÖ p=none	          üì© Delivered (no action, just reported)
‚ùå Fail	  ‚ùå Fail	  ‚ö†Ô∏è p=quarantine	    üì• Goes to spam folder
‚ùå Fail	  ‚ùå Fail	  ‚ùå p=reject	        üö´ Blocked/rejected

üîç Practical Example of a Received Email

Let‚Äôs analyze an actual email‚Äôs authentication headers:

Received-SPF: Fail (domain.com: 192.168.1.1 is not allowed to send mail)
Authentication-Results: dkim=pass header.d=domain.com
Authentication-Results: dmarc=pass action=none header.from=domain.com

‚Ä¢ SPF Failed because the sending IP is not authorized.
‚Ä¢ DKIM Passed, meaning the email wasn‚Äôt altered.
‚Ä¢ DMARC Passed (p=none), so the email is delivered normally.

If DMARC was p=quarantine, the email would go to spam.
If DMARC was p=reject, the email would be blocked.

üö® How to Protect Against Spoofing & Phishing?

‚Ä¢ Set SPF with strict -all to block unauthorized senders.
‚Ä¢ Use DKIM to prevent email tampering.
‚Ä¢ Set DMARC to p=reject or p=quarantine to prevent spoofed emails from reaching users.
‚Ä¢ Monitor DMARC reports (rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com) to track spoofing attempts.

üöÄ Final Takeaways

‚úÖ SPF, DKIM, and DMARC together prevent spoofing & phishing.
üö® SPF & DKIM failures increase the chance of emails going to spam.
‚ùå DMARC p=reject ensures full email protection (but can block legitimate emails if misconfigured).
üîç Always check email headers (Received-SPF, Authentication-Results) to see why an email went to spam
