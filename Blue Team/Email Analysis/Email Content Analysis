Email Content Analysis: Key Elements to Watch

When reviewing emails for potential threats, analyzing the content structure and looking for common red flags can help identify phishing attempts or other malicious activities.

MIME Analysis (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):

- MIME-Version: Defines the version of MIME protocol used.
- Content-Type: Specifies the format of the email (plain text, HTML, attachments).
- Content-Transfer-Encoding: Shows how the email content is encoded (e.g., Base64).


MIME Boundary:
Emails often contain both plain text and HTML versions, indicated by the presence of two boundary strings.

Red Flags:

- Organization name mismatch
- Awkward greetings or phrasing
- Social engineering techniques, such as creating urgency
- Poor grammar and multiple spelling errors


Encoding Types:

- Base64 Encoding: Used to encode attachments or obscure content (e.g., Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64).
- HTML Entities Encoding: Encodes special characters within the HTML content.
- URL Encoding: Hides malicious URLs within legitimate-looking links or encodes them in the email.


CyberChef is a powerful tool for decoding and analyzing email content:

- Decode Base64 strings to reveal hidden content.
- Analyze and deobfuscate encoded URLs or HTML entities.
- Visualize complex email headers and encoded data in an easy-to-understand format.
