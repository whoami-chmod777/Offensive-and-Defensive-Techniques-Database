In the context of email header analysis, using nslookup can help you gather useful information about domains, mail servers, and other DNS records. Below are some nslookup commands that can assist in analyzing email headers:

1. Lookup SPF Records

To verify the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records of a domain:

nslookup -type=txt <domain>
Example: nslookup -type=txt example.com

This will return the SPF record, helping to verify if the domain allows certain IP addresses to send emails on its behalf.


2. Lookup MX (Mail Exchange) Records

To identify which mail servers are responsible for receiving emails for a domain:

nslookup -type=mx <domain>
Example: nslookup -type=mx example.com

This shows the mail servers that handle incoming emails for the domain.


3. Lookup DKIM Records

To verify the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) public key used to authenticate email messages:

nslookup -type=txt selector._domainkey.<domain>
Example: nslookup -type=txt dkim._domainkey.example.com

This checks if the domain has a DKIM record for email authentication.


4. Lookup DMARC Records

To check if a domain uses DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):

nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.<domain>
Example: nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.example.com

This will show the DMARC policy used by the domain.


5. Reverse DNS Lookup

To resolve an IP address to a domain name:

nslookup <IP address>
Example: nslookup 192.168.1.1

This will resolve an IP address (from the email header) back to its corresponding domain, helping to trace the email origin.


6. Query CNAME Records

To find Canonical Name (CNAME) records, which show if a domain is an alias for another:

nslookup -type=cname <domain>
Example: nslookup -type=cname mail.example.com


7. Lookup SOA (Start of Authority) Records

To get information about the authoritative DNS server for a domain:

nslookup -type=soa <domain>
Example: nslookup -type=soa example.com

This shows the DNS server responsible for the domain’s records.


These commands are particularly helpful in verifying domain authenticity and identifying malicious or spoofed emails during email header analysis.



-- Check SPF, DKIM and DMARC Records --

Helpful 'nslookup' Commands for Email Header Analysis:

1. Check SPF Records:

You can use 'nslookup' to retrieve SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records from a domain. SPF records help verify whether an email was sent from an authorized mail server.

nslookup -type=txt <domain>
Example: nslookup -type=txt example.com | grep -i spf

nslookup -type=txt <v=spf1 include:xxx>*

*
Example: nslookup -type=txt social.helwan.edu.eg

Non-authoritative answer:
social.helwan.edu.eg	text = "v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all"

nslookup -type=txt social.helwan.edu.eg
   

2. Check DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) Records:

Use 'nslookup' to check DKIM records for verifying the email signature.

nslookup -type=txt <selector>._domainkey.<domain>
Example: nslookup -type=txt dkim._domainkey.example.com
   

3. Check DMARC Records:

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) records can be retrieved to see how the domain handles email authentication.

nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.<domain>
Example: nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.example.com
   

4. Resolve an IP Address:

If you want to resolve an IP address found in an email header to a hostname, you can use the following 'nslookup' command:

nslookup <ip-address>
Example: nslookup 192.168.1.1
   

When Analyzing Email Headers:

- SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Use 'nslookup' to check the SPF record of the sending domain. This helps verify if the sender’s IP is allowed to send emails for that domain.
- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Use 'nslookup' to check if the domain has DKIM configured, ensuring the email was signed by the sending domain.
- DMARC: Helps you determine how the domain instructs mail servers to handle authentication failures.
