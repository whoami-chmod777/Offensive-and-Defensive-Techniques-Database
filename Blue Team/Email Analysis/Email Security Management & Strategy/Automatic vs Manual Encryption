--- Automatic vs Manual Encryption ---

• Automatic Encryption
• Manual Encryption
• Which is Better


-- Automatic Encryption --

● Usually performed by email security appliances/gateways
  ○ Any edge/perimeter email appliance
● Most common with TLS encryption
  ○ Sending & receiving domains cooperate to establish TLS configs
● Common with DLP scanning workflows
  ○ Sensitive data detected -> email automatically encrypted
  ○ Rules can be established using other criteria
● Does not require any user interaction
● Not normally performed with individual user certificate encryption
  ○ Would require private keys on email systems
● Provides privacy and confidentiality


-- Manual Encryption --

● User-initiated encryption process
  ○ Usually using button/function in email client
● Uses user-specific certificates
● Can work with internal or public certificates
● Provides privacy/confidentiality, sender verification, non-repudiation
● Besides certificate setup, requires no additional configuration
● Possibility of data leakage without other processes in place
  ○ DLP scanning, etc


-- Which is Better --

● Automatic
  ○ Ensures secure communication
    ■ Between configured domains
  ○ Requires no user initiated process
  ○ Does not require individual user certificates
  ○ Normally no sender verification
● Manual
  ○ Requires users to initiate
  ○ Requires certificate for each user (as needed)
  ○ Provide sender verification, non-repudiation
● Both should be used
