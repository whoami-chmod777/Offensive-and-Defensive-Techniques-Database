- Email Headers -

All email messages contain "headers"
- Fields that contain information about the message - metadata
- Origin, destination, server information, etc

Numerous “standard” headers
- From, To, Subject, Reply-to, Message-ID, Received, etc

Others can be added (no standard)
- Commonly prefixed with X- (X-headers)
- Ex: X-Originating-IP: 192.168.1.1

Headers created/modified by system/program that sends message


- Standard Header Components -

Not all fields are always present
Originator Fields: From, Sender, Reply-To, Date
Destination: To, Cc, Bcc
Identification: Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References
Informational: Subject, Comments, Keywords
Trace: Return-Path, Received


- Originator Fields -

From: Author of the message, Mailbox that created the message (not necessarily who sent it)
Sender: Mailbox that transmitted the message, If From and Sender are the same, Sender will not be used
Reply-To: Not always present, Indicates where replies should be sent
Date: Time/date message was sent/queued


- Destination Fields -

All can contain single or multiple email addresses
To: Address of the recipient(s)
Cc: Carbon copy, Additional recipients, although content not directed at them
Bcc: Blind carbon copy, Similar to Cc, but recipients cannot see who message was sent to


- Identification Fields -

Message-ID
- Should exist on all messages
- Unique identifier for a particular version of a message (If a message is changed (ex: headers added) new Message-ID used)
- Used for tracking messages

In-Reply-To
- Contains Message-ID of original message(s), when replying
- May contain multiple IDs

References
- Similar to In-Reply-To
- Contains References and Message-ID of message(s) being replied to


- Informational Fields -

Subject
- Contains subject of message, shown in email client
- Can be prepended with “RE:” for replies

Comments
- May contain additional comments about the body of the message

Keywords
- Comma-separated list of words and phrases regarding message


- Trace Fields -

Return-Path
- Used when SMTP systems makes “final delivery” of message (Inserted at beginning of headers / Note: will not appear at top of headers when analyzing)
- Lists a single address for “error” messages to be sent
- Non-delivery failures, or mail system failures

Received
- Common to see multiple Received: fields
- Each SMTP server (hop) will prepend an additional field
- Includes server information (hostname, IP), ID, date/time info, who message is FOR
