--- Detecting Email Attacks ---

• Constantly Changing Threat
• Perimeter Detection
• Mailbox Detection
• Importance of User Vigilance


-- Constantly Changing Threat --

● Attackers constantly adapting tactics
  ○ New methods of delivery
  ○ Different ways to trick users
● New types of attacks
  ○ Phishing and social engineering
  ○ Ransomware and botnets
● Critical to have detection at multiple points
  ○ Perimeter
  ○ Mailbox-level


-- Perimeter Detection --

● First place that email enters network
  ○ Assuming on-premise email systems
  ○ Cloud providers often work differently
● Proper scanning of inbound (and outbound) email
  ○ Spam filtering
  ○ Scanning of attachments
  ○ Sandbox detonation of URLs
  ○ Advanced email analysis to detect BEC attempts
  ○ Methods to detect spoofed emails
  ○ DLP scanning for outbound
● Most options require third-party vendor solutions/products


-- Mailbox Detection --

● Defense in depth
● Perimeter won’t always catch everything
  ○ Well-disguised attacks
  ○ New methods
● Endpoint scanning that checks mailboxes
  ○ Can also detect executed malware from email
● Scanning on mail servers and databases
  ○ Attempts to stop before reaches user
● Similar to perimeter - often requires vendor products
  ○ Cloud-hosted often has built-in solutions ($$)


-- Importance of User Vigilance --

● Continues defense in depth solutions
● Users are often last line of defense
  ○ Security solutions will not always catch everything
● Security awareness training is critical for all organizations
  ○ Users need to know how to spot suspicious emails
■ Spoofed emails
■ Suspicious attachments/URLs
  ○ Know what NOT to do with them
● Easy reporting mechanisms
  ○ Built-in to email clients
  ○ Allows reporting of false positives
