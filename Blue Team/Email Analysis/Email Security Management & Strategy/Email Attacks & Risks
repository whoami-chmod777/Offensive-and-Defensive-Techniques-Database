-- Types Of Attacks --

● Attacks against email infrastructure
  ○ Similar to attacks against other systems
  ○ Exploiting email server vulnerabilities
  ○ Discovering and exploiting misconfigurations

● Attacks that use email as a mechanism
  ○ Phishing
  ○ Malware spread
  ○ Social engineering  
  ○ Business Email Compromise (BEC)


-- Social Engineering --

● Common component in any type of email attack
  ○ Phishing, malicious files, etc
● Attackers attempt to have users perform some sort of action for them
  ○ Supply credentials (phishing)
  ○ Open malicious software for reverse shell (malicious attachments/URLs)
  ○ Financial gains (Ransomware, BEC)
● Not just isolated to email attacks
  ○ Common tactic used by many attackers
● No email security can definitively block social engineering attacks
  ○ Systems are getting better
  ○ Relies heavily on user education and recognition


-- Spam --

● Commonly used as a blanket term for any malicious email
● Any unwanted, potentially malicious email
● One of the oldest forms of email attacks
● Can flood users’ inboxes if not properly filtered
  ○ Most may be solicitations/marketing
  ○ Some will have malicious intent
● Potential to impact mail server abilities to properly process email
● Often used in DDoS attacks
● Bottom line: unwanted email that may have malicious intent


-- Phishing --

● Multiple different types of phishing
● Most combine some form of social engineering
● Attackers attempt to trick users into supplying credentials, other sensitive info
● Two forms
  ○ Wording in email - sense of urgency
  ○ Phishing URLs with link in message body (or attached file)
● Spear phishing
  ○ Phishing that targets specific users - administrators, finance, etc
● Whaling
  ○ Phishing that targets senior leadership - CEO, COO, etc.


-- Malicious Attachments and URLs --

● Attackers attempt to get users to run malware
  ○ RAT for further control/persistence
  ○ Ransomware
● Commonly with MS Office attachments
  ○ Embedded macros
  ○ Functionality disabled by default, but will prompt users to enable
    ■ Combined with social engineering
● URLs used in same manner
  ○ Can be easier for attackers to get past filtering systems (system dependent)
  ○ Instead of opening attached file, relies on user downloading from website


-- Business Email Compromise --

● Attackers attempt to defraud company
● Most common method
  ○ Attacker poses as CEO (or other high level)
  ○ Emails employees in company
  ○ Asks for them to purchase gift cards and send them the numbers
● Usually target those in finance/accounting roles
  ○ Access to company funds/credit cards
● Can be very difficult to trace or recover money
● Protection relies heavily on user education
