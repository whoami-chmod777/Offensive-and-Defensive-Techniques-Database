- Email Beginnings -

1971 - First "email" sent on ARPANET: Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (US DOD)
1977 - RFC 733: First standard for “electronic mail” on ARPANET
1978 - First spam message
1989 - "You’ve got mail" on AOL
1994 - Webmail client developed
1996 - Hotmail released
2004 - Gmail created: Originally launched on several hundred Pentium III computers


- Technical Specs -

RFC 5322 - Internet Message Format
- Defines standard format - message body, headers, attachments, etc
- Updated with RFC 6854 - adds additional headers

RFC 2045, 2046, 2047 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- Adds standards for supporting attachments, various media types, associated headers

Protocols
- SMTP - RFC 5321 - port 25
- IMAP - RFC 9051 - port 143
- POP3 - RFC 1939 - port 110


- Design & Security Issues -

Email was not originally designed to be secure, no attachments
- No built-in sender verification, message integrity checks, encryption
- Additional controls required: SPF, DKIM, DMARC, Email security products

Easy to spoof email origins
- Headers can easily be modified/faked
- Can be difficult to detect sometimes

Email is everywhere, used by everyone
- Security issues make it easy to exploit
- User education is critical
