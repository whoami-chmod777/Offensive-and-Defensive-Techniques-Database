• What Should be Encrypted?

-- Encryption Methods --

● Confidential information is commonly sent via email
● Email is not a secure form of communication
  ○ Traffic is sent in clear-text and easy to intercept
● Multiple types of encryption can be added
  ○ S/MIME - Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
  ○ PGP - Pretty Good Privacy
  ○ TLS - Transport Layer Security
● All require additional configuration/infrastructure


-- S/MIME --

● Uses standard CA infrastructure
  ○ Either public or private
  ○ Private certificates cannot be used for external recipients
● Standard PKCS #7
● Provides functionality for encryption and digital signatures
  ○ Authentication and non-repudiation
  ○ Encryption and privacy
● Message normally signed/encrypted in email client
  ○ Signing - uses private cert of sender issued by CA
  ○ Encryption - uses public cert of recipient


-- PGP --

● Not as commonly used in enterprise environments
  ○ Standard is much more complex than S/MIME
● Uses combination of hashing, public/private key cryptography
● Originally used only "web of trust"
  ○ Involves others verifying and trusting certificates
  ○ Now supports key management servers
● Similar to S/MIME, requires users to sign/encrypt messages


-- TLS --

● Very different from S/MIME or PGP
● Encrypts entire session instead of individual message
  ○ Uses standard TLS protocol for encryption
● Requires configuration on both sending and receiving systems
  ○ Many systems now use TLS by default
● Easier and less expensive than using certificates
  ○ Does not require additional purchase for each user
  ○ Users do not need to manually encrypt messages
● Provides privacy and confidentiality only
  ○ Cannot be used for identity verification, non-repudiation
● Configuration will vary depending on systems in use


-- What Should be Encrypted --

● Any confidential information
● Personal information
  ○ PHI, PII
● Financial information
● Sensitive company IP (intellectual property)
● Compliance requirements based on industry
  ○ PCI-DSS
  ○ US healthcare - HIPAA
● Always work with legal/compliance departments
  ○ Guidance on what legally needs to be encrypted
