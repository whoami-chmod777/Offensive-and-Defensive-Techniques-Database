-- Email Protocols & Infrastructure --

• Email Infrastructure
• Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
• Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3)
• Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
• Mail Exchange (MX) Records


- Email Infrastructure -

DNS heavily used to support email
- MX records
- Email authentication and verification
- Standard DNS (A records, etc)

Internal networks
- Public-facing gateway
- Email security product(s)
- Email servers: Mailbox DB, transport servers, etc

External (internet) is much simpler


- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) -

Port 25, 587
Used to send, receive, and relay email messages
Primary protocol used by and between email servers (Also used by email clients for sending/receiving to servers)
Different than IMAP/POP3 (Used mainly for accessing/download email)
Original SMTP only supposed unauthenticated, unencrypted traffic (Allowed for "open relays")
ESMTP - Extended SMTP


- Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3) -

Port 110, 995
Older protocol, not as commonly used but still supported
Originally designed when internet connections were temporary (dial-up)
Designed for users to connect, download messages, disconnect (By default, messages deleted from server / One-way synchronization)
Many functional limitations compared to modern protocols (Multi-device synchronization / Push delivery)
First specification only supported unencrypted authentication (Additional extensions support encrypted communications)


- Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) -

Port 143, 993
Supports multi-client interaction with mail servers (Changes synced across multiple devices)
Plaintext communication (143), can be encrypted (IMAPS 587)
By default, messages left on server after downloading (Unless explicitly deleted)
Extension supports push notifications (Requires constant IMAP connection)


- Mail Exchange (MX) Records -

DNS records that direct email routing (Both internal networks and global internet)
Must always point to a domain name (A record), not an IP
Domain can use multiple MX records, ordered by 'priority' numbers (Used for redundancy purposes, or load balancing / Records with lower numbers are attempted first)
As mail is routed, servers query destination domains for MX records (MX record tells server where to send message next)

example.com   Record   Priority       Value              TTL
@               MX       10       mail1.example.com     3600
@               MX       20       mail2.example.com     3600
