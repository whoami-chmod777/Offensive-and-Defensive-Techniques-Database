-- Components of Infrastructure --

● Email security gateway
  ○ Inbound and outbound scanning
● Email infrastructure servers
● Endpoint tools
● DLP scanning
  ○ Outbound email
● Additional scanning systems as needed
  ○ Inspection servers in-line with internal mail flow
● Certificate infrastructure
  ○ Encryption, digital signatures


-- Email Security Gateway --

● Spam filtering (inbound and outbound)
  ○ May also house end-user quarantines
  ○ Other non-user accessible quarantines
● Attachment scanning (and quarantine)
  ○ Similar to AV/EDR scanning
● URL checking (sandbox detonation if possible)
● Phishing detection
  ○ Check messages against SPF
  ○ Verify DKIM
● Outbound encryption
● DLP functionality


-- Endpoint Tools --

● Standard AV/EDR
  ○ May use same enterprise client or standalone email client
  ○ Scans individual messages, attachments, etc
● Endpoint DLP agent
  ○ Stop/block sensitive data before sent
● Email client addons
  ○ Encryption tools
  ○ Automatic digital signature configuration
  ○ Email reporting


-- DLP (Data Loss Prevention) --

● Process and system to prevent leakage of sensitive information
● Checks messages for sensitive data
  ○ PII, PHI, credit card #s
  ○ Custom identifiers depending on industry/organization
● Common workflow
  ○ DLP scanner detects sensitive information in email
  ○ Stops outbound mail
  ○ Quarantines message for manual review
  ○ May notify sender of quarantined message
  ○ Depending on findings, can be released or revised and resent


-- Certificate Infrastructure --

● Used for internal encryption and digital signatures
  ○ Encryption provides confidentiality
  ○ Digital signatures provide non-repudiation and integrity verification
● Use internal PKI infrastructure
  ○ Certificates are not externally trusted
  ○ Encryption and signatures only work internally
  ○ No additional cost
● Use public, trusted CAs
  ○ Encryption and signatures work internally and externally
  ○ Can be significant cost depending on number needed
  ○ Normally only used for high security purposes
