--- Filtering & Scanning ---

• Scanning Basics
• Spam Filtering
• Phishing/Spoofed Email Detection
• Malicious Attachment Scanning
• URL Filtering
• Quarantines


-- Scanning Basics --

● Fine balance between security and usability
  ○ Effectively blocking threats
  ○ Still allowing legitimate messages
  ○ Low latency workflows
● Scanning components
  ○ Content filtering (spam, phishing, etc) - inbound and outbound
  ○ Malicious attachments/URLs
  ○ DLP
● Most scanning happens on email security gateway
  ○ Can have additional scanning systems in infrastructure
● All have options for allow/block lists


-- Spam Filtering --

● Most common type of scanning/filtering
  ○ Multiple "common" definitions
● Looks for unwanted messages
  ○ Marketing/bulk messages
  ○ May or may not be malicious
● Typically 3 levels of detection
  ○ 100% confidence spam
  ○ Possible spam
  ○ Not spam
● Quarantined (or blocked) depending on detection level
● Can rely heavily on reputation scores
● Scanning/detection methods vary depending on vendor


-- Phishing/Spoofed Email Detection --

● Attempts to identify "fake" messages
  ○ Examines headers and content (similar to spam)
  ○ Ex - From address is not accurate
● SPF, DKIM, DMARC
  ○ SPF - verify message sender (server) is verified
  ○ DKIM - domain owners sign all messages from domain
  ○ DMARC - instructs receiving servers what to do
● Some vendors combine with spam filtering


-- Malicious Attachment Scanning --

● Similar to AV/EDR scanning
  ○ Most email security products use AV/EDR vendor products
● 3 levels of detection (similar to spam)
● Sandbox detonation (possibly malicious)
  ○ Suspected malicious attachments executed in isolated environment
  ○ Can result in small email delay
  ○ If malicious, blocked
● Optionally send message, with attachment removed
  ○ If message not classified as spam/malicious
  ○ Usually has notification for user


-- URL Filtering --

● Very similar to spam/phishing scanning
  ○ Focuses only on URLs/links in message body
● Uses various intelligence sources to identify safety of domain
  ○ Reputation scores
  ○ Known malicious domains
  ○ Known safe domains
● Sandbox detonation
● If suspected malicious - "defang" URL
  ○ hxxps://www[.]google[.]com
● Multiple options for processing depend on vendor


-- Quarantines --

● Location for suspected spam, malicious emails
● Store message for period of time before automatically deleted
  ○ Useful for false positive retrieval
● User access to quarantine
  ○ Spam - user access
    ■ Unless message contains malicious attachment/URL
    ■ May also contain suspected phishing messages
  ○ Attachment/URL - no user access
● Spam digest
  ○ Periodic email sent to users showing what’s been quarantined
  ○ Useful to see if non-malicious messages have been caught
