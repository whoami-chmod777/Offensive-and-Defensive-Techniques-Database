● Ransomware attack spread via email attachments
● Used social engineering to convince users to open
  ○ Fake FedEx/UPS tracking notices
● When first spread, difficult to detect initial infection
  ○ After infection, files/systems encrypted
● During initial spread, reliable backups were only method of recovery
