• Need for Training
• Identifying Suspicious/Malicious Emails
• Reporting Suspicious Messages
• Other Resources
• Internal Phishing Exercises


-- Need for Training --

● General employees of organizations are not security experts
  ○ Cannot be faulted for not properly identifying malicious emails
  ○ Unless they are properly trained
● How to identify potentially malicious emails
  ○ Spoofed sender addresses
  ○ Hover over links
● What to do with suspicious emails
  ○ How do they report?
  ○ Who do they ask if they have questions?
● What tools are available to them?
  ○ Digital signatures


-- Identifying Suspicious/Malicious Emails --

● Employees need to be taught what to look for
● Check sender email address
  ○ Does it match the name in the From field?
  ○ Do they recognize and trust the sender?
● Check for attachments
  ○ Are they expecting the message with attachments?
  ○ If not, use extreme caution and do not open attachment
  ○ Report it to security team for analysis
● Check for URLs/links in the message
  ○ Again, are they expecting them?
  ○ If URL is visible, is it a recognized domain?
  ○ If not visible, hover over link WITHOUT CLICKING to check location


-- Reporting Suspicious Messages --

● All users should have an easy to use, convenient way to report
  ○ Button directly in email client
  ○ Simple process with minimal steps
● Reports should go straight to security team
  ○ Ideally in a ticketing system
  ○ Should offer a SAFE way to view original message
● Encourage users to report messages
  ○ Thank them for reporting
  ○ Work with management to offer rewards for catching malicious messages

“We’d rather you report something that’s perfectly safe than not report something that was malicious”


-- Other Resources --

● Knowledgebase of example malicious emails
  ○ Ideally ones that have been delivered to your organization
● Periodic in-person (or virtual) training
  ○ Should be interactive - let them ask questions
● Organization-wide digital certificates for email
  ○ Ability to verify the sender easily
  ○ Do not work outside of organization, unless purchased from trusted CA
● Always encourage users to ask questions, report any suspicious activity
  ○ Don’t want them to be intimidated or “afraid” of reporting


-- Internal Phishing Exercises --

● Simulated (but safe) phishing messages sent to internal users
  ○ Reporting to show who clicked opened/clicked on attachments or URLs
  ○ May also show who reported messages as malicious
    ■ Depends on product/vendor used
● Used to gauge level of additional training that may be needed
● Word of caution:
  ○ Try not to use results to justify punitive action
  ○ Sometimes necessary, but only with repetitive failures w/ no improvement
● Reward for successfully acting on test message
  ○ If reported, enter into drawing for gift cards, time off, etc.
