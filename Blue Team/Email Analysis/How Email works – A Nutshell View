-- Basic Working of Emails

1. A user composes an Email using MUA and sends it.
2. The Email is being transferred to the corresponding MTA/MDA. Some of the MTAs available today (Exim, Sendmail, QMail) and will handle the responsibilities of a MDA as well. So based on the headers of the Email, MTA determines the destination address, and it knows how to reach there, the mail is being transferred further to the MDA. The mail is being routed either locally or remote based on the Mail exchanger it is set to.
3. The MTA at the receiver end identifies the message and pass on the local MDA.
4. The local MDA hand overs the Email message to the MUA at the receiver end.
