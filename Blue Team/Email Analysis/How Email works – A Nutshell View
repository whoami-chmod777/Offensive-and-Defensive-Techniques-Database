-- How Email Works --

3. The MTA forwards the email through the Internet to the recipient’s MTA.
4. The recipient’s MTA stores the email in the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) (e.g., IMAP/POP server).
5. The recipient’s MUA retrieves the email from the MDA.
6. The email is displayed to the recipient in their MUA.
