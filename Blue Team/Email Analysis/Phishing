-- Phishing Overview --

Phishing may be one of the oldest cyber tricks, but it’s still one of the most effective. As companies strengthen their defences with advanced email filters and security tools, attackers have evolved their tactics to stay one step ahead.
Modern phishing focuses on precision and persuasion. Messages are carefully crafted, often mimicking real people, portals, or internal processes to trick even the most cautious users.

Common intentions behind phishing messages:

• Credential theft: Tricking users into revealing passwords or login details.
• Malware delivery: Disguising malicious attachments or links as safe content.
• Data exfiltration: Gathering sensitive company or personal information.
• Financial fraud: Persuading victims to transfer money or approve fake invoices.

With corporate perimeters now heavily fortified, phishing remains the easiest path to initial access. It targets the one vulnerability technology can’t fix: people. 


-- Why Spam Is Not Phishing --

Spam is just digital noise: annoying, but mostly harmless. Phishing, however, is a precision strike crafted to deceive employees and open a path into the company’s defences.

Spam focuses on quantity over precision. Unlike phishing, which aims to deceive specific users, spam messages are sent in bulk to flood inboxes with unwanted marketing or irrelevant content. 
Their goal isn’t usually to steal data, but to push exposure or engagement.

Common intentions behind spam messages:

• Promotion: Advertising products, services, or events. Often unsolicited or low-quality.
• Scams: Spreading fake offers or “get rich quick” schemes to attract clicks.
• Traffic generation (clickbait): Driving users to external sites or boosting ad metrics.
• Data harvesting: Collecting active email addresses for future campaigns.

You need to be careful when analysing each message. Look for the intention behind it. Not every unwanted email is a threat; sometimes it’s just spam that poses no real risk.


-- Phishing Takeover --

Attackers use some common techniques in almost every phishing attempt. In a phishing attack, at least one of the following techniques is present:

• Impersonation
• Social Engineering
• Typosquatting and Punycode
• Spoofing
• Malicious Attachments


➜ Impersonation

Some attackers may act as a person, department, or even a service to lure users. This is a way to gain credibility by impersonating the recipient manager or an important person within the company.

➜ Social Engineering

Social engineering in phishing is the art of manipulating people rather than breaking technology. 
Attackers craft believable stories, emails, calls, or chat messages that exploit emotions (fear, helpfulness, curiosity, urgency) and real-world context to lure the recipients of a message.

• Impersonation: Is a type of Social Engineering. The attacker is pretending to be McSkidy!
• Sense of urgency: We can observe words such as "urgent" and "immediately" to pressure the recipient.
• Side channel: The attacker tries to discourage the recipients from reaching McSkidy using his standard communication channels (phone and email address).
• Malicious intention: The attacker is trying to trick the user into giving VPN credentials. They can also try to ask for approval of payments, opening malware, or sharing sensitive data.

➜ Typosquatting and Punycode

Typosquatting is when an attacker registers a common misspelling of an organisation's domain. For example, glthub.com instead of github.com (note that there is an L instead of an i).                            

   
   Legitimate Domain           Typosquatted Domain        Technique
   ------------------          --------------------       ----------------
   google.com           ----->   gougle.com                Typo
   github.com           ----->   gIthub.com                Typo (capital I)
   amazon.com           ----->   amozon.com                Typo
   victoriassecret.com  ----->   victoriasecret.com        Missing letter
   homedepot.com        ----->   hoemdepot.com             Letters reversed


Punycode is a special encoding system that converts Unicode characters (used in writing systems like Chinese, Cyrillic, and Arabic) into ASCII. 
When typing punycodes in the browser URL bar, this will be translated into ASCII format, which is the accepted format by DNS.

With that resource, attackers can replace identical Latin letters; for example, a standard Latin a could be replaced with a Greek α.

Both techniques enable attackers to register malicious domains and trick users into believing they are receiving emails from the legitimate domain or accessing authentic websites.

An easy way to identify punycodes is by looking at the field Return-Path in the email headers. On the opened email, go down to the headers preview, and you will see the ACE prefix and the encoded non-ASCII characters!

➜ Spoofing 

Email spoofing is another way attackers can trick users into thinking they are receiving emails from a legitimate domain. 
The message looks like it came from a trusted sender (the display name and "From:" you see in the preview), but the underlying headers tell a different story. 
Modern email clients can easily reject spoofing attempts, but because Wareville email protection is down, some spoofing attempts can pass silently!

Let's check some essential fields in the email headers: Authentication-Results & Return-Path

On Authentication-Results, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are security checks that help confirm if an email really comes from who it says it does:

• SPF: Says which servers are allowed to send emails for a domain (like a list of approved senders).
• DKIM: Adds a digital signature to prove the message wasn’t changed and really came from that domain.
• DMARC: Uses SPF and DKIM to decide what to do if something looks fake (for example, send it to spam or block it).

If both SPF and DMARC fail, it’s a strong sign the email is spoofed, meaning the sender isn’t who they claim to be. In this message case, everything failed!

On the Return-Path we can see the real mail address zxwsedr@easterbb.com. This confirms the spoofing attempt on the missing calls email from the real sender

➜ Malicious Attachments

The most classic way of phishing is attaching malicious files to an email. Usually, these attachments are sent using some sort of social engineering technique in the body.

Malicious attachments can have multiple goals. Once opened, these files can install malware, steal passwords, or give attackers access to the device or network. 
A HTA/HTML files are commonly used for phishing because they run without browser sandboxing, meaning scripts have full access to the endpoint they execute on!


-- Trending Phishing --

Since email platforms and security tools got much better at blocking suspicious messages and attachments the attackers had to change their game:

• Instead of sending malware files (which are easily caught), they now focus on tricking users into leaving the company’s secure environment.
• They often use legitimate tools or websites to make their lures look trustworthy and get users to hand over their credentials or download malicious files themselves.

In short, most phishing attacks aren’t about dropping malware directly; they’re focusing on stealing access.

➜ Legitimate Applications

We can see attackers hiding behind trusted services such as Dropbox, Google Drive/Docs, and OneDrive, because those links look legitimate and often pass email filters.
The most common scenario involves a shared file containing a very attractive proposal, such as a salary raise document from HR or a laptop upgrade.
Once the user clicks on it, it redirects to a shared document with fake content. The goal is to lure users to access fake login pages to steal credentials or download malicious files.

➜ Fake Login Pages

Credentials are the main goal of attackers nowadays, and fake login pages are their favourite trick for performing this.
It's simple and mimics login pages from multiple typical applications that users interact with in their daily routines. Most of the time, they create fake email platforms, login portals such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google.

A Fake Microsoft Login Page sample. We can observe the fake domain microsoftonline.login444123.com/signin at the top.

➜ Side Channel Communications

Side-channel communication occurs when an attacker moves the conversation off email to another channel, such as SMS, WhatsApp/Telegram, a phone or video call, a texted link, or a shared document platform, to continue the social engineering in a platform without the company's control.
