-- Phishing Definitions --

Phishing is a social engineering tactic designed to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information through email, SMS, phone calls, or websites. Itâ€™s a growing threat that preys on human emotions and psychology.

Phishing is a cyberattack that uses deceptive messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details, often by impersonating trusted entities.


Key Phishing Tactics :

â€¢ Impersonation: Posing as trusted organizations or individuals
â€¢ Stealing Sensitive Info: Passwords, credit cards, and confidential files
â€¢ Malware Delivery: Through attachments, embedded files, or links
â€¢ Exploiting Humans: Targeting emotions and psychological weaknesses

How Phishing Works :

â€¢ Authority: Spoofing execs, managers, or IT staff to demand actions
â€¢ Trust: Posing as familiar entities (banks, partners) to build credibility
â€¢ Intimidation: Creating a sense of fear or urgency
â€¢ Social Proof: Validating legitimacy through fake consensus
â€¢ Urgency: "Act NOW!" to bypass rational decision-making
â€¢ Scarcity: Creating fear of missing out (limited offers, etc.)
â€¢ Familiarity: Establishing recognition to gain trust

ðŸš¨ Donâ€™t fall victim! Always double-check unexpected requests for sensitive information and be wary of urgent, emotionally charged messages.
