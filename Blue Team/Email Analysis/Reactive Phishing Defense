Phishing attacks can strike at any time, so having a clear, reactive defense strategy is critical to minimize damage. Here’s a breakdown of the key steps involved in a Reactive Phishing Defense:


-- Detection and Reactive Response --

Quick identification and response are vital.

> Containment
- Scope the Threat: Identify the extent of the phishing attack.
- Quarantine and Block Sender Artifacts:
	- Block email addresses, domains, and sender IPs.
	- Block emails by subject or content.
- Block Web Artifacts: Stop emails with malicious URLs.
- Block File Artifacts: Prevent malicious attachments by filename.

> Eradication:
- Remove Malicious Emails:
	- Use content search and eDiscovery.
	- Exchange delivery reports.
	- PowerShell’s get-messagetrackinglog for email traces.
- Remove Malicious Files: Eradicate harmful attachments.
- Abuse Form Submissions: Submit reports to services to blacklist phishing domains.
- Credential Changes: Initiate password resets for impacted users.

> Recovery
- Restore Systems: Recover compromised systems to a safe state.

> Communication
- Notify Affected Users: Ensure users are aware and taking action.
- Update Stakeholders: Keep internal teams and leadership informed.

> User Education
- End-User Training: Continuous education to recognize and avoid phishing attempts.

Proactive training and a reactive plan can significantly reduce the impact of phishing attacks.
