• Endpoints
• Endpoint Security Controls
• Endpoint Security Monitoring


>> Endpoints <<

• Workstations
  → Desktops and laptops
• Mobile Devices
  → Smartphones and tablets
• Servers
  → Email, web, database, file servers, etc.
• IoT Devices
  → Smart printers, cameras, appliances, etc.
  → OT, ICS, SCADA
• Networking Equipment
  → Routers, switches, firewalls, etc.


>> Endpoint Security Controls <<

• Antivirus / Antimalware
  → Scans files and activities
  → Matching patterns and signatures

• Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  → Real-time monitoring and response
  → Agent-based deployment
  → Monitor process, file, registry, and network activity

• Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
  → Integration of multiple security controls and telemetry
  → Runbooks and automated response to routine threats

• Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
  → Protect sensitive data at rest, transit, and in processing
  → Access controls, data masking, prevention

• User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UBA)
  → Monitoring user behavior patterns
  → Detect deviations from historic and contextual baseline
  → Insider threats, account compromise, data exfiltration

• HIDS / HIPS
  → Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)
  → Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)

• Host-based Firewall
  → Controls incoming and outgoing traffic on a host


>> Endpoint Security Monitoring <<

• Process Execution
  → Monitoring running processes
  → Executable files, PIDs, command-line arguments
  → Parent-child process hierarchy

• File System Changes
  → Creation, modification, deletion
  → File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

• Network Connections
  → Traffic and connections initiated from the endpoint
  → Associated processes and executables

• Registry Modifications
  → Monitor registry keys and values
  → Detect backdoors, persistence, detection evasion
