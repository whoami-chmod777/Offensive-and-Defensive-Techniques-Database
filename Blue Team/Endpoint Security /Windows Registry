In Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis, the Windows Registry is a crucial forensic artifact. It stores configuration settings, user activity data, and system state information â€” making it a goldmine for identifying malicious behavior, persistence mechanisms, and lateral movement.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of important Windows Registry hives, their functionality paths, and key areas SOC analysts should monitor:


--- Windows Registry ---

â€¢ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)
â€¢ HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)
â€¢ HKEY_USERS (HKU)
â€¢ HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)
â€¢ HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)

ðŸ”‘ 1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)

â€¢ Path: HKLM\
â€¢ Purpose: Contains configuration data for the entire system, hardware, drivers, services, and installed software.

â€¢ Important Subkeys:
  â†’ HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
      What to look for: Malicious drivers, unauthorized services.
      Why: Attackers may create or modify services for persistence.
    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
      What to look for: Auto-start entries.
      Why: Used for persistence by malware.
    HKLM\SAM
        What to look for: Windows account credentials (protected).
        Why: Accessed during credential dumping attacks (e.g., Mimikatz).
    HKLM\SECURITY
        What to look for: LSA secrets, cached credentials.
        Why: Targeted in credential attacks.
