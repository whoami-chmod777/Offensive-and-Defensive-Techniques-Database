-- File Carving Techniques --

1. Header/Footer Carving: Identifies file boundaries using specific markers at the beginning (header) and end (footer) of files.
2. Signature-based Carving: Recovers files based on unique signatures or patterns within raw data.
3. Carving with File Structure Knowledge: Reconstructs files by leveraging understanding of file formats and structures.
4. Content-Aware Carving: Extracts files based on their content rather than relying solely on signatures or structures.
5. File Carving with FileSystem Metadata: Utilizes file system metadata to aid in the recovery and reconstruction of files.
6. Smart Carving: Employs intelligent algorithms to optimize the file carving process, improving accuracy and efficiency.


-- Common File Types Recovered --

• Documents (DOC,DOCX, PDF, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, TXT)
• Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP, TIFF, RAW)
• Videos (AVI, MPEG, MP4, MOV, WMV, FLV)
• Audio (MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, OGG)
• Archives (ZIP, RAR, 7z, TAR, GZIP)
• Databases (MDB)
• Emails (PST, OST, MBOX, EML)
• ExecutableFiles (EXE, DLL's and other program files)
• WebFiles (HTML Files, CSS Stylesheets, Java Script (JS), and other web-related files)
• MiscellaneousFiles (Fonts (TTF), Metadata (XML,JSON), configuration files (INI), logfiles and more)


-- Magic Numbers --

Magic numbers in digital forensics are unique signatures within file headers used to identify file types and aid in data recovery.
