• High impact: Incidents with severe consequences, such as widespread service disruptions, data loss, or financial damage.
• Medium impact: Incidents that have a moderate impact on operations, data integrity, or service availability.
• Low impact: Incidents with minimal impact on operations, usually limited to individual systems or minor service disruptions.


3. Incident Severity:

• Critical: Incidents that pose a significant risk to the organization's security posture, infrastructure, or critical assets.
• High: Incidents that have the potential to cause considerable harm or disruption.
• Medium: Incidents with a moderate level of risk and potential impact.
