After incident classification, prioritization is done to determine the order in which incidents should be addressed.

Prioritization is based on the potential impact, urgency, and criticality of the incident. Factors considered during incident prioritization may include:

1. Impact Assessment:

• Assess the potential business impact, including financial, operational, reputational, and legal implications.
• Consider the scope and scale of the incident, such as the number of affected systems, users, or data.


2. Urgency:

• Evaluate the urgency to resolve the incident based on time sensitive factors.
• Consider regulatory or compliance requirements that specify response timeframes.


3. Criticality:

• Determine the criticality of the affected systems, assets, or services.
• Assess the potential for further compromise or escalation if the incident is left unresolved.


4. Risk Assessment:

• Evaluate the level of risk associated with the incident, including potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the organization's security posture.
• Consider the likelihood of recurring incidents or similar threats.


5. Business and Operational Priorities:

• Consider the organization's business priorities, customer impact, and service level agreements (SLAs).
• Assess the availability of resources, expertise, or dependencies for incident resolution.
