Prefetch Files are Windows system files that store data about how programs are used, facilitating faster application launch times by predicting which files will be needed next and preloading them into memory. They contain information such as file paths, timestamps, and usage statistics, aiding in system optimization and performance enhancement.

C:\Windows\Prefetch: This directory contains prefetch files for 64-bit applications.


C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Prefetch: This directory contains prefetch files for 32-bit applications running on a 64-bit operating system.
