-- Checking DNS Logs --

DNS is one of the most basic building blocks of the internet. DNS is basically a technology that is used for domain - IP resolution. Network traffic is basically conducted over IPs and DNS is the system that tells us what the IP address for the server of google.com when we need to access "google.com" .

We should keep the followings when checking these logs:

• Has the system made domain requests in categories that actually should not access?
• Has the system made domain requests that are actually risky categories?
• Were any known services (google drive, one drive, etc.) attempted to access during situations like data leak, and etc.?
• Is there any systems that make requests to domains obtained from Threat Intelligence resources?
• Investigations on DNS logs should be conducted to detect if there is access to DNS Over TLS (DOT) or DNS over HTTPS (DOH) services.

DNS logs can be divided into 2 different categories from the SOC Analyst's point of view as the DNS server events, and the DNS queries.


-- DNS Logs Categories --

DNS logs can be divided into 2 different categories from the SOC Analyst's point of view as the DNS server events, and the DNS queries.

DNS Server Records are simply the DNS audit events on the server that hosts the DNS records. These events are kept on "Application and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> DNS-Server\Audit" section on the Eventlog on Windows servers. Operations like adding, deleting, editing, records, etc. on the DNS server could be monitored on these logs.

DNS queries are a difficult source of logs to collect and analyze. DNS servers do not keep these logs by default and they must be enabled in order for them to keep these logs. The DNS queries generated directly by the DNS service are also difficult to analyze. However, these are records where you can find which systems query the domains in the obtained IoCs. In summary, applications that provide DNS server services such as Microsoft DNS, Bind DNS, Dnsmasq record the DNS queries they receive upon request.

IOCs (Indicator of compromise) are the evidences that take part before, during and after a cybersecurity incident and are revealed during the analysis and investigation of that cyber security incident. The IOCs are crucial in determining the details like the type of the attack, tools leveraged during the attack, and who the possible attacker is.

Bind logs, that are DNS server services generally used in Linux systems, can be accessed via the "/var/log/querylog" log file in the default configuration.


-- A sample DNS log --

{ "timestampt": 1591367999.306059, "source_ip": "192.168.4.76", "source_port": 36844, "destination_ip": "192.168.4.1", "destination_port": 53, "protocol": "udp", "query": "testmyids.com", "qtype_name": "A", }


-- DNS Query Logs --

DNS query logs generally contain the following data

• Date-Time
• Querying IP, Port
• Query type
• The requested domain

DNS logs can be obtained directly from the server, as well as in the systems that collect these queries over the network.


-- SolarWinds SUNBURST --

In DNS log analysis, the requested domain and its reputation/category are important. The domains utilized in the 2020 "SolarWinds SUNBURST" attack could have been detected by analyzing the DNS logs. The domains that a network device, a database or 3rd party application servers will communicate are clear. Domains that the manufacturer shared with you and are supposed to make communications should be investigated through the DNS logs for:

• First time visited domains
• Domains or subdomains over a certain character size
• Detection of NX returning domains
• Domain IOC controls
• Detection of DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTPS accesses

When the DNS logs below are analyzed, we see that there are DNS requests made towards subdomains that were randomly created from the IP address 192.168.10.12 in 1 minute time period. This activity of DNS requests may be a sign for a potential DNS tunneling activity. The investigation should be conducted at the endpoint by determining the source process that creates this activity.

Our investigations on the DNS log below show that the requested domains appear to be legitimate. Considering that the Oracle Database server with an IP address of 192.168.10.3 is querying these domains, the Oracle server asking the domains of Microsoft services used for data transfer makes this activity suspicious.
