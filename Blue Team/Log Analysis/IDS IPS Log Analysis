The IDS/IPS concept and solutions are technologies developed at the point where only rule-based access controls of firewall devices are not sufficient in the security world. Roughly, while the firewall works on a rule basis so that red apples shall pass and yellows not, IDS/IPS solutions can check whether there are worms in the apple or not. In other words, it has a decision-making mechanism by inspecting the packet content. In this way, it can prevent suspicious/malicious packets/requests from reaching the target and prevents systems from being affected by this attack.

Today, although IDS/IPS technology is provided by many Firewall manufacturers as an additional module/license on firewall devices, it is only available in devices with IDS/IPS as core functions.


-- IDS vs IPS --

• IPS: Intrusion Prevention System - Detects and prevents the suspicious activities
• IDS: Intrusion Detection System - Only detects the suspicious activities

IDS and IPS have signature database. A signature is a set of rules designed to detect known attacks. The structure that presents this set of rules centrally is called the signature database.
Network activities that trigger these signatures can be blocked or only detected according to the determined action of the signature. In other words, IDS and IPS are the same device/product, but 2 different concepts/terms emerge according to the action in the signatures
Snort or Suricata are two well known open source IDS/IPS solutions in the market.

-- IPS log Details --

• Looking at the details of the above log
• date= date information
• time= time information
• devname= system name
• devid= system ID information
• tz= timezone
• logid= log ID information
• type= log type (values like traffic, utm, event, etc.)
• subtype= log sub type (values like forward, vpn, webfilter, virus, ips, system etc.)
• level= log level
• severity= incident severity level
• srcip= source IP address
• dstip= destination IP address
• srccountry= source country
• dstcountry= destination country
• action= action information
• service= service information
• attack= attack details
• srcport= source port information
• dstport= destination port information
• direction= direction of packet
• attackid= attack ID information
• msg= additional message information

IDS/IPS logs usually contain information about source-target IP and port information, action information, information about attack type, attack category, and attack level.


-- Information Investigation --

Following information should be investigated in details when analyzing IDS/IPS logs;

• The direction of attack (inbound or outbound) should be checked.
• The event severity level should be checked. Levels are usually set as low, medium, high, critical. High and critical levels indicate that activity is more important, quick action is required, and a false positive is less likely.
• A different signature trigger state should be checked between the same source and target. Triggering different signatures means that the severity level of the event should be raised higher and a faster action should be taken. The event is resolved within the service level agreement (SLA) depending on its severity level in case of following situations like:
  → If a single signature is triggered
  → there are no different requests from the relevant source
  → there is no different accept in the firewall logs
• Is the port/service specified in the attack detail running on the target port? If it is running, the event level should be raised to the critical level, and the target system should be checked for infection. It should also be checked whether a response has been returned to the relevant system from the source. If the answer is no, blocking the attacking IP address as a precaution would be an appropriate action.
• Is the action taken just detection or has it been blocked as well? If the attack is blocked and there are no other requests from the same IP address on the firewall, we can wait a little longer for taking the action. However, if the action taken for the attack is only a detection, then other similar requests should be reviewed and block action should be applied if the content of the requests coming from the IP address is not false positive.


-- Suspicious Activities --

Following suspicious activities can be detected monitoring the IDS/IPS logs;

• Port scanning activities
• Vulnerability scans
• Code Injection attacks
• Brute-Force attacks
• Dos/Ddos attacks
• Trojan activities
• Botnet activities
