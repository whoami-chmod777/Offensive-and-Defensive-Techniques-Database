PDF document malware analysis involves examining PDF files to detect and understand embedded malicious content and behaviors.

When analyzing a PDF for malicious content, important things to examine include:

• JavaScript: Check for embedded scripts, often used to exploit vulnerabilities.  
• Embedded Files: Look for embedded executables or other files that could be malicious.  
• Suspicious Metadata: Analyze metadata for unusual or suspicious entries.  
• Actions and Triggers: Identify automatic actions like opening other files or executing scripts upon opening.  
• Obfuscation Techniques: Detect obfuscated content designed to evade detection.  
• Object Streams: Examine compressed or encrypted object streams that may hide malicious content.  
• File Structure: Look for anomalies in the PDF structure that might indicate tampering.
