-- Goals of Malware Analysis --

The goal of malware analysis is to understand and mitigate threats by uncovering the functionality, origin, and spread mechanisms of malicious software.


-- Important aspects to check during static analysis to catch potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior include --

• File Metadata: Check for anomalies in file properties, such as unusual timestamps or missing digital signatures.
• Code Structure: Look for suspicious or obfuscated code patterns.
• Imports and API Calls: Identify potentially malicious API calls, such as those related to process injection or network communication.
• Strings: Search for hardcoded strings that might indicate URLs, IP addresses, or commands.
• Entropy: Assess the entropy of file sections to detect packing or encryption.
• Sections: Examine the structure and characteristics of PE file sections for inconsistencies.
• Signatures: Use known malware signatures to identify potential threats.
• Permissions: Check requested permissions that may indicate malicious intent.
• Configuration Files: Analyze embedded configuration files for malicious settings.
• Libraries and Dependencies: Identify unusual or unnecessary libraries that could be malicious.

These aspects help in identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that may indicate the presence of malware.


-- Types of Malware --

-- Types of Malware Analysis --

Static Analysis: Examines malware without executing it to understand its code and structure.
Dynamic Analysis: Involves running the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.
Hybrid Analysis: Combines both static and dynamic methods for comprehensive insights.
