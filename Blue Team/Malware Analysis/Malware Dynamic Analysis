-- What is Dynamic Malware Analysis --


-- Advantages of the Dynamic Analysis Method --

• It produces much faster results than the static analysis method,

-- Importance of Dynamic Malware Analysis for SOC Analysts --

Both analysis methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. In fact, these two methods do not substitute each other. When you want to analyze a malware, you need to combine these two methods and analyze it. 
As a SOC analyst, you are racing against time. The faster you can detect a harmful situation, the faster you can take action against it. SOC analysts first prefer the dynamic analysis method since it can produce much faster results than the static analysis.
Dynamic analysis method, which can be summarized as "run the malware and examine its activities", may seem simple, but it is a very difficult and dangerous analysis method for a person who does not know what he is doing.

-- What Should We Pay Attention to when we conduct a Dynamic Analysis? --

We mentioned that the dynamic analysis is the method that we actually run the malware on our own system and analyze its activities on the operating system.
So what should we do after running the malware? Are we going to run it and just watch the screen?
