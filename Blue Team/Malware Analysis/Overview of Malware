-- About Malware --

What exactly is malware? The name is derived from malicious software, which is any program that has been created for malicious purposes, such as encrypting files or stealing passwords. Whilst covering malware in detail is out of scope for this course, you need to know what malware is, as we will be hunting for it in this section.
There are a number of types of malware, from Spyware to Ransomware, Trojans to Worms. Whilst they can vary dramatically in their sophistication and ability to evade security defenses (such as anti-virus software), they are all ultimately bad in some way and have a negative impact on the systems that become infected.
In Threat Hunting, we are searching advanced threats that have managed to enter the network (typically via phishing or social engineering attacks), and then operate covertly so that they are not discovered. It is our job to uncover them using technical methods.


-- How to Hunt For Malware --

There are two main things we’ll be looking for when hunting on endpoints: 

● Covert malware found using IOCs shared with the hunter (usually from a Threat Intelligence team).
● Comparing known-good values against systems to check for any differences. An example of this would be comparing properties of Windows processes to see if they have been altered. For example, we could create an IOC file that has the file hashes of important processes such as winlogon.exe, smss.exe and others. Obviously this would alert these files to us, because they should match – so we would set the IOC value to “IS NOT”. If any files with important names do not match their official hash, we know that they have been modified or replaced, and this is something we would look into more.
