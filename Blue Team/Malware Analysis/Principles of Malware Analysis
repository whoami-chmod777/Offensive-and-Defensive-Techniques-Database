--- Principles of Malware Analysis ---

Malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file to understand its functionality, operation, and methods for defence against it. 
By analysing a malicious file or application, we can see exactly how it operates, and therefore, know how to prevent it. For example, could the malicious file communicate with an attacker's server? We can block that server.

Could the malicious file leave traces on the machine? We can use these to determine if the malware has ever infected another device. 
Instead of fearing malware, we can take a proactive approach by translating technical findings into practical defensive measures and understanding how the malware fits into an attacker's techniques.

There are two main branches of malware analysis: static and dynamic. Static analysis focuses on inspecting a file without executing it, whereas dynamic analysis involves execution. We will come to these shortly.

-- Sandboxes --

In cyber security, sandboxes are used to execute potentially dangerous code. Think of this as disposable digital play-pens. 
These sandboxes are safe, isolated environments where potentially malicious applications can perform their actions without risking sensitive data or impacting other systems.

The use of sandboxes is part of the golden rule in malware analysis: never run dangerous applications on devices you care about.

Most of the time, sandboxes present themselves as virtual machines. Virtual machines are a popular choice for sandboxing because you can control how the system operates and benefit from features such as snapshotting, which allows you to create and restore the machine to various stages of its status. 

To reiterate, it is imperative to understand that potentially malicious code and applications should only be run in a safe, isolated environment. 


-- Interactive: Static Analysis ---

Static analysis can be a quick and effective way to understand how the sample may operate, as well as how it can be identified. 

• PeStudio


Some of the information that can be gathered from static analysis has been included in the table below:

| Information| Explanation                                                                                                                       | Example                                    |
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Checksums  | These checksums are used within cyber security to track and catalogue files and executables.                                      | a93f7e8c4d21b19f2e12f09a5c33e48a           |
|            | For example, you can Google the checksum to see if this has been identified before.                                               |                                            |
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Strings    | "Strings" are sequences of readable characters within an executable. This could be, for example, IP addresses, URLs,              | 138.62.51.186                              |
|            | commands, or even passwords!                                                                                                      |                                            |

| Imports    | "Imports" are a list of libraries and functions that the application depends upon. Rather than building everything from scratch,  | CreateFileW                                |
|            | applications will use operating system functions and libraries to interact with the OS. Useful for understanding system usage.    |                                            |
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Resources  | "Resources" contain data such as the icon that is displayed to the user. Malware may hide data here to trick the user.            | N/A                                        |

-- PeStudio --

First, we will use PeStudio to gather information about the executable.

Executive Summary:

• Launch PeStudio
• Load the executable into PeStudio
• Click on the "indicators" tab in the dropdown
• Look for the SHA256Sum

First, we will launch PeStudio and load the executable into it. You can drag and drop the executable into the PeStudio window, or load it by selecting File -> Open File from the toolbar. PeStudio will display some information about the executable.

For us, at this stage, the file > sha256 property within the table is of interest. This value is a checksum, which is a unique identifier for the executable. We can keep a note of this SHA256 as threat intelligence.

Next, we will proceed with reviewing the "Strings" of the executable. You can do this by clicking on the "strings" indicator on the left pane of PeStudio.

In the context of malware analysis, strings are sequences of readable characters present within an executable. 
This could be, for example, IP addresses, URLs, commands, or even passwords! As a malware analyst, it's great to have a look at these, as these could reveal the attacker's command infrastructure, which we can use for our defences.


-- Interactive: Dynamic Analysis --

Dynamic analysis involves executing the malicious sample to identify its behaviours and how it interacts with the operating system.

• Regshot
• ProcMon



-- Regshot --

Regshot is a widely used utility, especially when analysing malware on Windows. It works by creating two "snapshots" of the registry—one before the malware is run and another afterwards. The results are then compared to identify any changes.

Malware aims to establish persistence, meaning it seeks to run as soon as the device is switched on. 
A common technique for malware is to add a Run key into the registry, which is frequently used to specify which applications are automatically executed when the device is powered on.

Let's load up Regshot and create a capture of the registry as it currently exists. 

First, change the output directory of the capture to the user's Desktop using the box with three dots in the "Output path" section.

Then, once set, let's create our first snapshot. Press 1st shot and then Shot on the dropdown. Please note that this may take a few minutes to complete.

Once we have executed our sample, let's return to Regshot and capture our second snapshot, using the same procedure as above. Click on the 2nd shot button and press Shot in the dropdown. 
Regshot is now capturing the registry again, and outputting the differences to a file.

And now, after a few seconds, let's press the Compare button that appears. We can search for the executable within the log that opens up. 


-- ProcMon --

Proccess Monitor is used to monitor and investigate how processes are interacting with the Windows operating system. It is a powerful tool that allows us to see exactly what a process is doing. For example, reading and writing registry keys, searching for files, or creating network connections.

Open Process Monitor (ProcMon), process Monitor will automatically start capturing events of various processes on the system.

After allowing a minute to pass, ensuring the sample has fully executed, we will now stop capturing. To stop capturing more events, click on the Play button in the toolbar of Process Monitor.

Here we can create some filters to remove some of the noise that we don't care about. Because we want to only look at this downloader.exe sample for this demonstration, we can apply a filter like so:

• Apply the Process Name filter
• Set the condition to is
• Put in the name of the process we wish to see within the text area
• Press the Add button to apply this filter
• And finally click OK to save.

Now it is much easier to investigate how the process is interacting with the operating system. Here are some Operations that may be of interest to us:

• RegOpenKey
• CreateFile
• TCP Connect
• TCP Recieve
