5. Tips for Effective Analysis


1. Display Filters

Use display filters to isolate specific traffic in the capture file. Here are some useful examples:

General UDP Traffic: udp
HTTP Requests: http.request
TCP Traffic on Port 80: tcp.port == 80
TCP Window Size Greater Than or Equal to 8000: tcp.window_size_value >= 8000
Destination IP and TCP Traffic: ip.dst_host == 192.168.1.7 && tcp
NTP or UDP Traffic on Port 20000: ntp or udp.port == 20000  


2. Following Streams

To analyze the flow of packets between hosts:

Follow TCP Stream: Follow > TCP Stream
Follow UDP Stream: Follow > UDP Stream
Follow SSL Stream: Follow > SSL Stream
Follow HTTP Stream: Follow > HTTP Stream


3. Viewing Capture Statistics

Wireshark provides various statistics about the traffic in the capture file:

Protocol Hierarchy: Displays the percentage of packets or bytes used by each protocol in relation to the total traffic.

Conversations: Offers details on communications between hosts, including:

- Source and destination hosts
- Ports used
- Total bytes and packets exchanged

Endpoints: Lists all unique hosts in the capture, along with:

- Packets sent and received
- Bytes sent and received


4. Accessing Statistics

To access statistics in Wireshark: Navigate to the Statistics menu for:

- Protocol Hierarchy: 'Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy'
- Conversations: 'Statistics > Conversations'
- Endpoints: 'Statistics > Endpoints'


5. Tips for Effective Analysis

- Save Filters: Create and save frequently used filters for quick access.
- Color Rules: Use coloring rules to differentiate between types of traffic.
- Capture Options: Adjust capture options to focus on specific protocols or ports.
- Export Data: Export specific data or statistics for reporting or further analysis.
