📊 Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Enhancing Cyber Defense 🚨
The core functions of IDS and IPS for building robust network and endpoint security. Here’s a breakdown of the main components:

🔍 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- IDS solutions provide passive monitoring, logging, and alert generation without interrupting traffic.
- Ideal for situations needing out-of-band threat awareness without active interference.

🚫 Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- IPS actively inspects traffic, blocks malicious packets, and can terminate suspicious connections in real-time.
- Deployed inline for instant prevention and mitigation, with comprehensive logging for auditing.

🌐 Network-Based IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS)
- Operate at the network level, monitoring traffic flows and flagging/blocking harmful activities across network appliances.

🖥️ Host-Based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS)
- Deployed on individual endpoints to monitor host activities (file access, logins, apps) and mitigate potential threats directly on the device.

🔍 Detection Methods
1. Signature-Based Detection: Matches activities against known attack patterns; excellent for known threats.
2. Behavior-Based Detection: Detects anomalies by comparing against a baseline; valuable for catching new threats.
3. Rule-Based Detection: Uses custom policies for violation detection; effective but requires frequent updates.

🧩 The JoHari Window Model: Identifies different types of knowledge in security analysis:
- Known Known: Threats we are aware of and understand.
- Known Unknown: Threats we are aware of but do not fully understand.
- Unknown Known: Insights we have but haven’t actively recognized.
- Unknown Unknown: Completely unforeseen threats that pose unique challenges.

Implementing a combination of IDS and IPS strategies is key for comprehensive detection, alerting, and proactive defense against evolving cyber threats.
