Snort is a flexible and powerful tool for network intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS). It operates in multiple modes and helps to monitor, log, and prevent suspicious activities across networks.

🔑 Key Snort Modes
1. Sniffer Mode: Monitors and displays network packets in real-time.
2. Packet Logger Mode: Logs packets to files for deeper analysis.
3. IDS/IPS Mode: Detects and prevents suspicious activities by analyzing packets against predefined rules.


⚙️ Installation and Configuration
• Install Snort: sudo apt install snort
• Identify Your Network Range: Use ifconfig or ip a s to set up HOME_NET.
• Rules and Configuration:
  - Configuration file location: /etc/snort/snort.conf
  - Back up your config file: sudo cp snort.conf snort.conf.bak
  - Open config for editing: sudo nano snort.conf
• Verify Configuration: Test setup with sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf


⚙️ Edit Configuration
• Open snort.conf: sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
• Step #1: Set Network Variable
  - Set your internal network's address range in the HOME_NET variable to define which network Snort will monitor.
• Step #7: Customize Rule Set
  - Customize your Snort rules by locating the $RULE_PATH in snort.conf. Comment out any rules you want to disable to tailor detection.
• Verify Configuration: Test setup with sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
