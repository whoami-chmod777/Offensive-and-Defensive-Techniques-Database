--- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) ---

The core functions of IDS and IPS for building robust network and endpoint security. Here’s a breakdown of the main components:

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
• IDS solutions provide passive monitoring, logging, and alert generation without interrupting traffic.
• Ideal for situations needing out-of-band threat awareness without active interference.

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
• IPS actively inspects traffic, blocks malicious packets, and can terminate suspicious connections in real-time.
• Deployed inline for instant prevention and mitigation, with comprehensive logging for auditing.

Network-Based IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS)
• Operate at the network level, monitoring traffic flows and flagging/blocking harmful activities across network appliances.

Host-Based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS)
• Deployed on individual endpoints to monitor host activities (file access, logins, apps) and mitigate potential threats directly on the device.

Detection Methods
1. Signature-Based Detection: Matches activities against known attack patterns; excellent for known threats.
2. Behavior-Based Detection: Detects anomalies by comparing against a baseline; valuable for catching new threats.
3. Rule-Based Detection: Uses custom policies for violation detection; effective but requires frequent updates.

The JoHari Window Model: Identifies different types of knowledge in security analysis

Known Known: Threats we are aware of and understand.
Known Unknown: Threats we are aware of but do not fully understand.
Unknown Known: Insights we have but haven’t actively recognized.
Unknown Unknown: Completely unforeseen threats that pose unique challenges.


-- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) --

• Passive monitoring and analysis
• Alert generation
• Logging
• Out-of-band


-- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) --

• Blocking and dropping packets
• Terminating connections
• Alert generation
• Logging
• Inline deployment


-- Network-Based IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS) --

• Operate at the network level
• Analyze traffic flowing through network appliances
• Alert, log, and/or block malicious traffic


-- Host-Based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS) --

• Operate at the endpoint level
• Analyze activities on the host (file system, logins, apps)
• Alert, log, and/or block malicious host actions


--- Detection Methods ---

-- Signature-based Detection -- 

• Comparing traffic or activities against known attack patterns
• Effective at identifying known threats
• Cannot detect what it doesn’t know exists

-- Behavior-based Detection -- 

• Identifying anomalies that deviate from a pre-established baseline
• More effective at detecting unknown threats
• More likely to generate false positives

-- Rule-based Detection -- 

• Enforcing policies to define acceptable actions or violations
• Highly customizable to an organization’s requirements
• Requires frequent maintenance and rule updates
