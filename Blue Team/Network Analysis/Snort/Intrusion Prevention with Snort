--- Intrusion Prevention with Snort ---

Snort, commonly known as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), can also function as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) when configured inline with network traffic. Here’s a breakdown of using Snort for Intrusion Prevention (IPS):

1. Configure Snort for Inline Mode
- Inline mode allows Snort to actively block or drop malicious traffic based on configured rules.
- Set the HOME_NET and EXTERNAL_NET variables in the Snort configuration file ('/etc/snort/snort.conf') to specify your internal and external networks.


2. Install and Configure Prerequisites
- Install nfqueue (Netfilter Queue) or iptables for packet redirection, which is essential for inline prevention.
- Redirects all forwarded traffic through the Netfilter Queue for Snort to inspect.

Example: sudo iptables -A FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0


3. Modify the Snort Configuration
- Enable IPS mode by adding or uncommenting the following lines in 'snort.conf': config policy_mode:inline
- Load or create custom rules in 'local.rules' or other rule files in the '/etc/snort/rules' directory.


4. Run Snort in IPS Mode
- Start Snort with IPS capabilities by binding it to the network interface and setting '--daq nfq' (for Netfilter Queue).   

sudo snort -Q --daq nfq --daq-var queue=0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3
sudo snort -q -A console -i enp0s3 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -Q
sudo snort -q -A console -i enp0s3:enp0s8 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf --daq afpacket -Q

Explanation:
- '-Q' activates IPS mode.
- '--daq nfq' tells Snort to use the Netfilter Queue.
- '--daq-var queue=0' specifies the queue number set in iptables.


5. Write IPS-Specific Rules
- Modify rules to include 'drop', 'reject', or 'sdrop' actions, which specify how Snort should handle detected threats.

Example Rule 'Drop or Block:
drop tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"Block Suspicious HTTP Traffic"; sid:1000001;)
drop tcp any any <> any 21 (msg: "Drop any FTP traffic"; sid: 1000003; rev:1;)

This rule blocks suspicious HTTP traffic on port 80 directed to the internal network.


6. Testing the Setup
- Simulate attacks (e.g., using hping3 or nmap) to verify that Snort is blocking or dropping traffic as expected.

sudo hping3 -S -p 80 -c 3 <target IP>
ftp test.rebex.net

- Check Snort logs and alert files to confirm blocked activities.


7. Monitor and Fine-Tune
- Regularly review logs, adjust rules, and monitor traffic patterns to fine-tune Snort's performance.
- Use fast alert mode ('-A fast') for efficient alerting or full alert mode for detailed event data.

Using Snort in IPS mode provides proactive protection by stopping malicious traffic before it reaches vulnerable systems. It’s a cost-effective and powerful tool for small to medium businesses seeking to bolster their network security.
