--- Simulating Attacks ---

We will simulate the following network attacks and create specific rules in Snort to detect each of these attacks, and guide you through simulating them.

1. Port Scan Attack
2. SQL Injection Attack
3. SSH Brute Force Attack


> Step 1: Setup Snort to Monitor Traffic

Ensure that Snort is configured to run in inline mode (for active response) or IDS mode (for passive monitoring). Hereâ€™s a quick recap of how to run Snort:

Start Snort in IDS mode: sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort/ -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

Replace eth0 with your network interface.


> Step 2: Create Snort Rules

Add the following rules to your /etc/snort/rules/local.rules file:

Rule 1: Port Scan Detection: alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Port Scan Detected"; flags:S; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
Rule 2: SQL Injection: alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80,8080 (msg:"SQL Injection Attempt Detected"; content:"1%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271"; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
Rule 3: SSH Brute Force: alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"SSH Brute Force Detected"; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; sid:1000004; rev:1;)

After adding the rules, restart Snort to apply the changes: sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort/ -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

1. Simulating Port Scan Attack

Use Nmap to perform a SYN scan: nmap -sS <target-IP>

Snort should detect the scan attempt.

2. Simulating SQL Injection Attack

Use curl to simulate an SQL injection attack on the PHP application we set up: curl "http://<target-IP>:8080/index.php?id=1%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271"

Check Snort for SQL injection alerts.

3. Simulating SSH Brute Force Attack

Use Hydra to perform a brute force attack against the SSH service: hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<target-IP>

Check Snort for alerts indicating the SSH brute force attack.


> Step 4: Monitor Alerts and Responses

As you run these attack simulations, keep an eye on the Snort console. You should see alerts similar to the following:

For port scan: [**] [1:1000002:1] Port Scan Detected [**]
For SQL injection: [**] [1:1000003:1] SQL Injection Attempt Detected [**]
For SSH brute force: [**] [1:1000004:1] SSH Brute Force Detected [**]
