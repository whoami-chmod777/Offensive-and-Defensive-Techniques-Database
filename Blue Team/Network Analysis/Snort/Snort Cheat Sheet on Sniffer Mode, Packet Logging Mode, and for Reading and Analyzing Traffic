-- Snort Cheat Sheet on Sniffer Mode, Packet Logging Mode, and for Reading and Analyzing Traffic --


-- Snort in Sniffer Mode --

Sniffer mode captures packets in real-time and displays them in the console. Use this mode to monitor network traffic actively.

Starts Snort in sniffer mode on specified interface.
sudo snort -i <interface>	

Displays link-layer header data (e.g., MAC addresses).
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -e	

Shows application-layer data (packet payloads).
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -d	

Displays basic IP and TCP/UDP/ICMP information.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -v	

Shows full packet data in both hex and ASCII.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -X	

Displays alerts directly in the console.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -A console	

Runs in quiet mode, reducing startup messages.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -q	

Outputs packets in ASCII format (useful for readability).
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -K ascii	

Strips down to only critical info for a cleaner display.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -C	

Generates traffic for testing; monitor with Snort to see captured packets.
curl http://example.com	



-- Snort in Packet Logging Mode --

Packet logging mode saves packets to a log file, allowing for in-depth offline analysis.

Starts Snort logging mode, saving logs to the specified directory.
sudo snort -i <interface> -l /var/log/snort	

Logs packets to the current directory.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -l .	

Logs alerts quickly in a simple format.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -A fast	

Logs packets in binary (PCAP) format.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -b	

Quiet mode with minimal console output, logging to file.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -q -l /var/log/snort	

Logs packets in ASCII format for readability.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -K ascii	

Logs packets with full details.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -A full -l /var/log/snort	

Enables syslog logging, sending alerts to syslog.
sudo snort -i enp0s3 -s	

Reads and analyzes a saved pcap file.
sudo snort -r /path/to/pcap_file.pcap	

Use tcpdump to review the log file generated by Snort.
sudo tcpdump -r snort.log.<timestamp>	


 
-- Reading and Analyzing Traffic --

These commands allow you to review and analyze packet logs saved in Snort’s logging mode.

Reads a saved packet capture file (PCAP format).
sudo snort -r <filename>	

Analyzes a specific Snort log file.
sudo snort -r snort.log.<timestamp>	

Reads Snort logs in TCPdump, disabling DNS lookups for faster analysis.
tcpdump -r snort.log.<timestamp> -nn	

Displays packet content in both hex and ASCII for detailed analysis.
sudo snort -r snort.log.<timestamp> -X	

Displays alerts directly in the console from a saved capture file.
sudo snort -r snort.log.<timestamp> -A console	

Searches for specific alerts within the log file.
grep "alert" snort.log.<timestamp>	

Runs in quiet mode to avoid extra output during log review.
snort -r snort.log.<timestamp> -q	

Reads logs in ASCII for readability.
sudo tcpdump -A -r snort.log.<timestamp>	

Shows application-layer data (packet payloads) for analysis.
sudo snort -r snort.log.<timestamp> -d	

Reads Snort’s alert file to review recorded alerts in real-time.
cat /var/log/snort/alert
