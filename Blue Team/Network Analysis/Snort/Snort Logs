Snort Logs capture detailed information about network traffic flagged by Snortâ€™s intrusion detection/prevention system. These logs provide insights into potential security incidents and aid in forensic analysis.


Key Points
- Log Files Location: By default, Snort logs are stored in /var/log/snort.
- File Types:
  -> Alerts: Summary of detected threats, typically in plain text (alert.fast
  -> Full Packet Dumps: Raw packet data (snort.log.* files), viewable with tools like tcpdump or Wireshark for deeper analysis.


-- Useful Commands --

Capture Logs to Directory
sudo snort -i <interface> -l /path/to/log/dir -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Opening Snort Logs in Wireshark
sudo wireshark snort.log.126327863872

View Alerts in Console
tail -f /var/log/snort/alert

Analyze Packet Logs
sudo tcpdump -r /var/log/snort/snort.log.*

Replay Logs for Testing
sudo snort -r /path/to/snort.log -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Running Snort in Full Alert- and Fast Alert Mode
sudo snort -A full -l /var/log/snort -i enp0s3 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q
sudo snort -A fast -l /var/log/snort -i enp0s3 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q


Log Management Best Practices:

- Rotation: Use log rotation to manage file sizes and avoid storage issues.
- Reviewing Frequency: Regularly review and analyze logs to quickly detect potential threats.
- Archiving: Keep historical logs as part of compliance and forensic investigation processes.


Snort logs are essential for monitoring, analyzing, and managing network security, providing a record of activity for tracking incidents and improving security defenses.
