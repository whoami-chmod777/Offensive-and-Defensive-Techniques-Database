Snort Variables & Rules

• Snort Variables
• Snort Rules
• Rule Keywords & Arguments


-- Snort Variables --

Snort rules work on variables rather than actual IPs/ports:
• Allows to use rules in any environment without modifying them
• Located under Objects -> Object Management -> Variable Set

Variable Types:
• $*_NET (Network/subnet addresses, such as $HOME_NET)
• $*_SERVERS (Individual server IPs, e.g. $DNS_SERVERS)
• $*_PORTS (TCP/UDP ports, like $HTTP_PORTS)


Correct variable definition is critical to proper NGIPS operations:

• Always tune $HOME_NET and $EXTERNAL_NET values
  > Setting $EXTERNAL_NET to !$HOME_NET won’t always work
    >> May leave trusted segments unprotected

• Best Practices
  > Set $HOME_NET to all protected subnets & public ranges you own
  > Leave $EXTERNAL_NET as "any"

• Tune all used $*_SERVERS and appropriate
  > If in doubt, set $*_SERVERS to $HOME_NET


-- Snort Rules --

Each Snort Rule consists of a Header and a Body

• Rule Header
  > Tells what traffic to look at (L3/L4), Source/destination IPs/ports, protocol & flow direction
  > Defines an action to take (Alert, pass, disabled, generate events, drop and generate event)

• Rule Body (Rule Options)
  > Describes the attack (Payload) (Keywords, arguments & patterns, a match triggers the rule action)
  > Contains Event Message


- Snort Rule Example -

• Rule Header: alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS

• Rule Body: 
(msg:“Test rule fires”; flow:to_server,established; \
uricontent: “cgi/main/malware.exe”; reference:cve-1991-1345; \
classtype:web-application-activity; sid:9991; rev:1;)


• Rule Body is formed with the aid of keywords & arguments
  > The Body always starts with "(" and ends with ")"
    >> If multiple lines are needed, separate them with “\”
  > Keywords end with ":" and the last argument/option end with ";"
    >> Arguments/options are separated by commas (msg:"Test rule fires"; flow:to_server,established;)


-- Rule Keywords & Arguments --

• Keyword : content
  > Describes the string to look for in a packet
  > ASCII, hex characters (surrounded by "|") or both ("|28|C|29|/bin/sh" matches (C)/bin/sh)
  > Sample Arguments (nocase, offset, depth, distance)

• Keyword : pcre
  > Allows to use Perl-compatible regular expressions to look for content
  > Regular expression must be enclosed within "//" (/mail(file|seek)\.cgi/)
  > Optional modifiers follow the regex (/regex/ismxAEGRBUIPHDMCKSY)

• Keyword : flow
  > Allows to specify the direction of the traffic
  > Sample Arguments (to client, from client, to server, established, stateless)
