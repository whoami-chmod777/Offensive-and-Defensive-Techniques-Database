The File Transfer Protocol is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

The file transfer protocol takes in a USER and a PASS command as authentication.


-- Searching for Valid Credentials --

tcpdump -tt -r tcpdump_challenge.pcap -A | grep -i 'user\|pass\|login' | grep -v "User-Agent"

tcpdump -nn -r tcpdump_challenge.pcap -A port 21 | grep -E 'USER|PASS'
tcpdump -nn -r tcpdump_challenge.pcap -A port 21 | grep -E 'USER|PASS|230|530'
tcpdump -nn -r tcpdump_challenge.pcap -X port 21 | grep -E 'USER|PASS|230|530'
tcpdump -nn -r tcpdump_challenge.pcap -AX port 21 | grep -E 'USER|PASS|230|530'

tcpdump -A -r tcpdump_challenge.pcap 'port http or port ftp or port telnet' | grep -i 'user\|pass\|login'


Summary of Valid Credentials:

Username: admin
Password: admin

USER admin
PASS admin

------------------------

Username: root
Password: pass123

USER root
PASS pass123

------------------------

Username: administrator
Password: password

USER administrator
PASS password

------------------------

Username: admin
Password: password123

USER admin
PASS password123

------------------------

Username: demo
Password: password

USER demo
PASS password


Each time you see the USER followed by PASS it indicates an attempt to log in using FTP. 


These are the credentials captured from the tcpdump:

admin/admin
root/pass123
administrator/password
admin/password123
demo/password


Look for Server Response Codes in the Full FTP Session

230: User logged in successfully (valid credentials).
530: Authentication failed (invalid credentials).

Valid Credentials: Look for a 230 response code after the PASS command.
Invalid Credentials: Look for a 530 response code after the PASS command.
