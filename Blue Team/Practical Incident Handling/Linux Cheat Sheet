🔐 User Accounts
Identify suspicious user accounts or attacker-created temporary users in /etc/passwd.

• passwd -S [User_Name]
• grep :0: /etc/passwd
• find / -nouser -print

🔎 grep :0: — Display UID 0 and GID 0 accounts
🕵️ find / -nouser — Identify files without an associated user (often linked to deleted or attacker accounts)


📄 Log Entries
Detect suspicious events in system logs, such as:

Large numbers of login failures (telnetd, sshd, etc.)
Abnormally long input strings (possible buffer overflow attempts)


📊 Resources
Check for abnormal CPU or memory usage compared to known baselines.

--> Check CPU load (system load average)
• uptime

--> Check memory utilization
• free


⚙️ Running Processes (focus on those running with root privileges)
Identify abnormal or suspicious processes that could indicate malicious activity.

• ps aux
• lsof -p [pid]


🔧 Services
List and inspect services that might be unauthorized or misconfigured.

• service --status-all     # RedHat and Mandrake systems
• chkconfig --list         # Alternative for RedHat/Mandrake


📅 Scheduled Tasks (focus on cron jobs run by root or UID 0)
Detect suspicious scheduled tasks that could indicate persistence mechanisms.

• crontab -l -u [account]
• cat /etc/crontab
• cat /etc/cron.*


🌐 Listening and Active TCP/UDP Ports
Identify abnormal or unauthorized listening or active network ports.

• lsof -i         -- Compare this to a baseline
• netstat -nap    -- Compare this to a baseline


🔁 ARP
Detect unusual or spoofed IP–MAC address mappings.

arp -a          -- Compare this to a baseline


📁 Files
Spot suspicious files such as:
Abnormal SUID root files (potential privilege escalation)
Unusually large files (potential data hoarding or exfiltration)

--< Abnormal SUID root files
• find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 -print

--> Overly large files
• find /home/ -type f -size +512k -exec ls -lh {} \;
