-- Whois information analysis --

Whenever a domain name is registered, information such as postal addresses, phone numbers, contact names and authoritative domain name servers are requested by the registrar.
This information can be the starting point of attacks such as social engineering, war dialing, war driving and network mapping.

Looking up and analyzing Whois information, is a reconnaissance technique that does not involve even a single packet being sent from the attacker to the targeted organization’s network. Such reconnaissance is known as passive reconnaissance.
Passive reconnaissance techniques are particularly interesting due to the fact that they cannot be detected.
