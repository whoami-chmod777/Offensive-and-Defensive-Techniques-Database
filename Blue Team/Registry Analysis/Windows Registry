-- What is Windows Registry --

• The Windows Registry is a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data. This configuration data can be about the hardware, the software, or the user's information. It also includes data about the recently used files, programs used, or devices connected to the system. As you can understand, this data is beneficial from a forensics standpoint.
• You can view the registry using regedit.exe a built in Windows utility to view and edit the registry.
• The Windows registry consists of Keys and Values.
• When you open the regedit.exe utility to view the registry, the folders you see are Registry Keys.
• Registry Values are the data stored in these Registry Keys.
• A Registry Hive is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk.


-- Structure of the Registry --

The registry on any Windows system contains the following five root keys

• HKEY_CURRENT_USER
• HKEY_USERS
• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
• HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
• HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

HKEY_CURRENT_USER: Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on. The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCU.
HKEY_USERS: Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subkey of HKEY_USERS. HKEY_USERS is sometimes abbreviated as HKU.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE: Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKLM.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT: Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR. Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key contains settings that override the default settings and apply only to the interactive user. The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key provides a view of the registry that merges the information from these two sources. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows. To change the settings for the interactive user, changes must be made under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes instead of under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. To change the default settings, changes must be made under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. If you write keys to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, the system stores the information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. If you write values to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and the key already exists under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, the system will store the information there instead of under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG: Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.


-- Accessing Registry Hive Offline --

Most of these hives are in the C: Windows System32 Config directory and are:

1. DEFAULT (mounted on HKEY_USERS DEFAULT)
2. SAM (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM)
3. SECURITY (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY)
4. SOFTWARE (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE)
5. SYSTEM (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM)

Hives containing user information:

Apart from these hives, two other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory. For Windows 7 and above, a user’s profile directory is in C:\Users\<username>\ where the hives are:

• NTUSER.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER when a user logs in)
• The NTUSER.DAT hive is in the directory C:\Users\<username>\
• USRCLASS.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES)
• The USRCLASS.DAT hive is in the directory C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
• AmCache hive is in C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve. Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.
