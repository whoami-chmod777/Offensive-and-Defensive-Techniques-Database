-- The Digital Forensics Investigation Process --


+----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+ 
| Identification | -> |  Preservation  | -> |   Collection   | -> |  Examination   | -> |    Analysis    | -> |  Presentation  | -> |    Decision    |
+----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+       


1. Identification

• Confirm that an incident or crime has occurred
• Sources: victim reports, detections, audits
• Prepare to respond: locate and preserve evidence
• Define scope and focus of the investigation

2. Preservation

• Keep evidence intact and unaltered ("the system is a crime scene")
• Capture a snapshot of the system’s current state
• Identify relevant data (volatile / non-volatile)
• Maintain chain of custody (who, what, when, where, why)
• Secure physical and digital evidence

3. Collection

• Gather all identified evidence (devices, peripherals)
• Ensure legal authority (warrant, consent, scope)
• Collect volatile data first
• Reduce irrelevant data
• Document and verify integrity

4. Examination

• Inspect, analyze, and interpret evidence
• Work with forensic images, not originals
• Extract and translate raw data into readable form
• Use a checklist for consistency
• Discover hidden or deleted data

5. Analysis

• Interpret the evidence: how does it support the hypothesis, how does it refute the hypothesis, what does it mean in context
• Data context: don’t analyze in a vacuum.
• Iteration: analyze, ask new questions, re-analyze.
• Relational analysis: links between people, places, systems, and events.
• Functional analysis: how system/operational configurations relate to the incident.
• Temporal analysis: timelines, sequences of activity, and pattern analysis.


6. Presentation

• Communicate the results: legal teams, executives, and decision makers.
• Ensure clarity: findings should be understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.
• Guide the audience: let the evidence lead to logical conclusions; avoid speculation.
• Executive summaries: highlight key results, significant findings, and clear explanations.
• Comprehensive documentation: include tools used, evidence discovered, and reasoning behind relevance.
• Reproducibility: another forensic analyst should be able to reach the same conclusion.

7. Decision

• Evaluate the results: review all findings, conclusions, and documentation for completeness and accuracy.
• Make a decision: determine if the evidence and conclusions are sufficient, decide whether additional investigation is needed.
• Prosecution or remediation: support legal proceedings by building a case and providing expert testimony, implement corrective or preventive measures within the organization.



-- Order of Volatility --  

The Order of Volatility defines the sequence in which digital evidence should be collected

+---------------------------+    +------------------------------------+    +----------------------------+    +----------------------------+    +---------------------------+    +---------------------------+
|   CPU Registers and Cache | -> | RAM and Active Network Connections | -> | Temp Files and System Logs | -> |     Disk Storage Data      | -> |       Remote Logging      | -> |        Archive Media      |
+---------------------------+    +------------------------------------+    +----------------------------+    +----------------------------+    +---------------------------+    +---------------------------+

1. CPU Registers and Cache
• Processor Registers: Very fast, temporary storage inside the CPU; holds current instructions, storage addresses, and active data.
• Cache Memory: Stores and returns frequently used instructions and data to speed up processing.
• Running Processes: Currently active programs, including paths, PIDs, and command-line invocations.

2. RAM and Active Network Connections
• Random Access Memory (RAM): Short-lived data (session info, unsaved documents, process data).
• Network Connections: Current TCP/UDP connections and open ports.
• Routing Table: Lists pathways to network destinations.
• ARP Cache: Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

3. Temp Files and System Logs
• Temporary Files: Downloads or temp configurations stored in %TEMP%, C:\Windows\Temp, /tmp.
• Swap Files: Temporary memory space on disk used by the OS.
• System and Application Logs: Contain event records but can be overwritten or cleared.

4. Disk Storage Data
• Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Persistent system and user data.
• Solid State Drives (SSDs): Faster but use TRIM/garbage collection, which can erase data.
• System Configurations: OS components, installed software, user files, documents, executables, and backups.

5. Remote Logging
• Endpoint Telemetry: Local logs (system, security, app, network, DNS, etc.).
• Centralized Log Collection: Logs aggregated on SIEM servers or cloud storage; replicated and managed with rotation policies.

6. Archive Media
• Long-term Storage: Backup tapes, optical disks (CDs/DVDs/Blu-rays), archival drives, or cloud archival storage.
• Backups: Files and databases stored for recovery.
• Security Controls: Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of stored evidence.
