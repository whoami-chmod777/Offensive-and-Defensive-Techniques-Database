🎯 Objective: Detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents using a structured lifecycle.


📘 Framework: PICERL

• Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned


🧰 Core Tools

• Wireshark – Network packet analysis
• DeepBlueCLI – Windows Event log hunting
• YARA – Malware pattern detection
• TheHive5 – Case management
• ATT&CK Navigator – Incident classification
• PowerShell / CMD – Host-based investigation


🧩 Step-by-Step Procedure

1️⃣ Preparation

• Maintain IR plan, contacts, runbooks, and playbooks.
• Establish baselines & log sources.


2️⃣ Detection & Analysis

• Use SIEM to correlate events.
• Collect indicators with YARA or event log tools: yara -r rules.yar /path/to/suspect
• Analyze packets: tshark -r network.pcap -Y "http.request"


3️⃣ Containment

• Isolate host: Get-NetAdapter | Disable-NetAdapter -Confirm:$false
• Block malicious IPs: iptables -A INPUT -s 203.0.113.1 -j DROP

4️⃣ Eradication & Recovery

• Remove persistence, malicious services, files.
• Patch vulnerabilities, restore from clean backups.


5️⃣ Lessons Learned & Reporting

• Document timeline & corrective measures.
• Metrics: detection time, response time, affected assets.
• Store artifacts & analysis summary in TheHive case.
