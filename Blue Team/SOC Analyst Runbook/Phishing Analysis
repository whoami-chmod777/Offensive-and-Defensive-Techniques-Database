EMAIL FLOW (ASCII)

Sender (Bob)                  Bob's Mail Server                 Alice's Mail Server                 Recipient (Alice)
+-------------+               +-------------------+             +--------------------+              +--------------+
|  Bob        | -- SMTP --->  |  Gmail / SMTP MX  | -- SMTP --> |  Yahoo / SMTP MX   | -- POP3/IMAP|   Alice      |
|  (Sender)   |               |  (outbound MTA)   |             |  (inbound MTA)     | <----------- |  (Recipient) |
+-------------+               +-------------------+             +--------------------+              +--------------+

Legend:
- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (sending/relaying mail between servers)
- POP3/IMAP: Protocols used by the recipient to retrieve mail from their mail server

Bob (the sender) writes an email and sends it using his mail service (e.g., Gmail).  
Gmail’s server sends the message via SMTP across the internet to Alice’s mail server (e.g., Yahoo).  
Alice then connects to her Yahoo mailbox using POP3 or IMAP to receive and read Bob’s email.


• Email Headers: Email headers are lines of metadata attached to an email and contain useful information like sender, receiver, subject, and mail servers.
• Email Body: The email body is the main part of the email that the receiver reads and contains the message, links, images, or attachments.

• SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – 25 (default), 465 or 587 (secure)
• POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) – 110 (default), 995 (secure)
• IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) – 143 (default), 993 (secure)

                                    (Mail Retrieval Agent - MRA)


MUA (Mail User Agent) – Used by the user to write, send, and read emails.
→ Example: Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Thunderbird

MSA (Mail Submission Agent) – Takes the email from the MUA and sends it to the first mail server using SMTP.

MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) – Transfers and routes the email across multiple mail servers until it reaches the recipient’s server.
→ Example: Postfix, Sendmail, Exim

MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) – Accepts the message from the MTA and puts it into the recipient’s mailbox.
→ Example: Procmail, Dovecot LDA

MRA (Mail Retrieval Agent) – Allows the recipient to fetch or sync their emails from the mailbox using POP3 or IMAP.
→ Example: Outlook IMAP, Apple Mail, Thunderbird

-----------------------------------------------------------
Simple Explanation:
Bob writes an email using Gmail (MUA).  
The Mail Submission Agent (MSA) sends it to Gmail’s server.  
Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) pass the message across the internet until it reaches Yahoo’s mail server.  
The Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) places it into Alice’s inbox.  
Finally, Alice’s email client (MRA) retrieves the email using POP3 or IMAP so she can read it.
-----------------------------------------------------------

An email moves from the sender’s client through mail agents (MSA → MTA → MDA → MRA) using SMTP and is retrieved by the recipient with POP3 or IMAP.



-- Phishing Attack Types --  

• Information Gathering – Collecting information about targets to create realistic phishing emails.
• Credential Harvesting – Stealing usernames and passwords through fake login pages or deceptive links.
• Malware Delivery – Sending malicious attachments or links that install malware.
• Spear Phishing – Highly targeted phishing aimed at specific people or organizations.
• Whaling – Phishing attacks aimed at high-profile individuals like CEOs or executives.
• Vishing / SMiShing / Quishing – Using phone calls, SMS, or QR codes to trick users into giving information.
• Business Email Compromise (BEC) – Using real or stolen business accounts to send fraudulent requests or scams.
• Spam – Unwanted or irrelevant bulk emails, usually without direct malicious intent.



-- Phishing Attack Techniques --  

• Pretexting – Creating a fake story or reason to trick someone into giving information.
• Spoofing and Impersonation – Faking an email address or domain to look like a trusted person or company.
• URL Manipulation – Using fake or shortened links to hide the real malicious website.
• Encoding – Hiding malicious code or URLs using Base64, HTML, or JavaScript encoding to avoid detection.
• Attachments – Sending files that the victim downloads and runs to install malware.
• Abuse of Legitimate Services – Using trusted sites like Google Drive or Dropbox to deliver malicious content.
• Pharming – Redirecting users to fake websites by poisoning DNS or using malware to steal data.



-- Email Analysis Methodology -- 

• Initial Triage – Quickly check the email and decide how serious and urgent it is.
• Header and Sender Examination – Look at sender details, IPs, and mail servers to find the real source.
• Content Examination – Read the email text to spot fake language, tone, formatting or social engineering tricks.
• Web and URL Examination – Collect and analyze all links and domains used in the email.
• Attachment Examination – Safely extract and check attached files for malware or sandbox behavior.
• Contextual Examination – Compare with other incidents to see if it’s part of a bigger campaign.
• Defense Measures – Take needed actions like blocking domains, alerting users, or resetting passwords.
• Documentation and Reporting – Record all findings, actions, and outcomes in a report and close the



-- Email Header and Sender Analysis --  

Look at these key points to find the true sender and verify authenticity:

• Date and Time: – The exact date and time the email was sent; check for inconsistencies or delays between hops.
• From: – The sender’s display name and email address (can be spoofed in phishing attempts).
• To: – The recipient’s email address showing who the message was intended for.
• Subject: – The subject line of the email, giving an idea of the message’s content.
• Return-Path: – The real address used for mail delivery or bounces; useful for tracing the sending server.
• Reply-To: – The address replies will go to (can differ from From; often abused in phishing).
• Message-ID: – A unique identifier created by the sending mail server to track the message’s journey.
• Received: – Lists all servers and IPs the email passed through; unexpected hops may indicate spoofing.
• Authentication-Results: – Displays SPF, DKIM, and DMARC check results.
• SPF Result: – Tells if the sender’s IP is authorized to send for that domain.
• DKIM Signature: – Confirms if the message content and sender domain are genuine.
• DMARC Policy: – Defines how the receiving server should handle SPF/DKIM failures.
• Originating IP Address: – The first external IP in the Received chain (actual sending source).
• Mail Server Hostnames: – The domain names of each mail server in the route.
• X-Headers: – Custom headers added by servers or gateways (e.g., X-Originating-IP, X-Mailer) that may reveal the original sending system or tools.
• X-Sender-IP: – Reveals the real IP address of the sender; useful for tracing origin and identifying malicious hosts.


How to Analyze the "Received" Chain:
• Read from Bottom to Top: The bottom-most “Received” header shows the first mail server that handled the email, while the top one shows the final server that delivered it to the recipient.
• Check for Unexpected Hops: If there are unknown, mismatched, or suspicious servers in the chain, it may indicate tampering, relaying through unauthorized systems, or redirection by malicious actors.
• Verify IP Addresses and Domains: Cross-check each IP address and domain with trusted sources (e.g., WHOIS, DNS records, or internal threat intel) to confirm they belong to legitimate mail servers.

Why it matters:
• Analyzing the “Received” headers helps uncover spoofing attempts, misconfigured domains, or phishing attacks.
• Validating these entries against SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records strengthens confidence in the email’s authenticity.

-- Email Authentication Methods -- 

Email Authentication Methods (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) – Checks if the sending mail server is authorized for the domain.
➡️ Uses DNS records listing valid sender IPs.
✅ Pass if IP matches, ❌ Fail if not in record.

Received-SPF: pass (google.com: domain of example.com designates 192.168.1.20 as permitted sender) client-ip=192.168.1.20;


DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) – Confirms message integrity and sender authenticity.
➡️ Email is signed with a private key; recipient verifies using a public key in DNS.
✅ Pass if signature valid, ❌ Fail if modified.

DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
 d=example.com; s=selector1;
 h=from:subject:date:message-id;
 bh=AbCdEfGh1234567890==;
 b=RANDOMLONGENCRYPTEDSIGNATURE==


DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) – Enforces SPF/DKIM checks and gives reporting visibility.
➡️ DNS policy tells how to handle failed messages (none / quarantine / reject).
✅ Pass if SPF or DKIM align with the “From” domain.

Authentication-Results: mx.google.com;
 spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=example.com;
 dkim=pass header.d=example.com;
 dmarc=pass (p=REJECT sp=REJECT dis=NONE) header.from=example.com


>> Email Authentication Verification Commands <<

  SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
----------------------------------

# Check SPF record for a domain
nslookup -type=txt namecheap.com | grep -i spf
dig TXT namecheap.com | grep -i spf

# Check included SPF records
nslookup -type=txt _spf.sendgrid.net | grep -i spf
dig TXT _spf.google.com | grep -i spf
host -t txt example.com | grep -i spf

curl -s https://dns.google/resolve?name=example.com&type=TXT | jq '.Answer[] | select(.data | test("spf"))'

# Example Output
shodan.io text = "v=spf1 ip4:216.117.2.180 ip4:69.72.37.146 include:_spf.google.com -all"

# Interpretation
v=spf1       → SPF version
ip4:         → Authorized sending IPs
include:     → Reference another domain’s SPF record
-all         → Hard fail (reject unauthorized senders)
~all         → Soft fail (mark as suspicious, don’t reject)


  DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
--------------------------------------

# Check DKIM record (replace selector1 with actual selector name)
nslookup -type=txt selector1._domainkey.namecheap.com
dig selector1._domainkey.namecheap.com TXT

dig selector1._domainkey.example.com TXT +short | awk -F'p=' '{print length($2)}'

# Example Output
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC1LfA...

# Interpretation
v=DKIM1  → DKIM version
k=rsa    → Key type
p=       → Public key for verifying DKIM signature


  DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Check DMARC record
nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.namecheap.com
dig _dmarc.namecheap.com TXT

curl -s https://dns.google/resolve?name=_dmarc.example.com&type=TXT | jq '.Answer[]'

# Example Output
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com

# Interpretation
v=DMARC1  → DMARC version
p=        → Policy (none / quarantine / reject)
rua=      → Reporting address for DMARC aggregate reports

SPF   → Verifies if the sender server is authorized to send mail for the domain.
DKIM  → Confirms message integrity and authenticity using digital signatures.
DMARC → Enforces SPF/DKIM checks and defines policy for failed authentication.

-- Email Content Analysis -- 

Look at these key points to identify phishing or malicious intent:

Email Body: – Main text of the message; check for urgency, fear, or financial requests.
Language and Tone: – Poor grammar, unusual phrasing, or unnatural urgency.
Links: – Hover to see the real URL; watch for misspelled domains or redirects.
Attachments: – Mentioned but missing, or attached with suspicious names/extensions.
Logos and Branding: – Slight visual changes or wrong colors/fonts can indicate fakes.
Sender Signature: – Check if the signature matches the claimed company format.
Requests for Action: – Login links, payments, data updates — red flags for phishing.
Embedded Code: – Hidden HTML, JavaScript, or base64 content in the message source.
Mismatch: – Visible URL ≠ actual hyperlink destination.
Social Engineering: – Emotional pressure, authority impersonation, or urgency tactics.


MIME Analysis (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):

MIME-Version: – Defines which MIME protocol version is used.
Content-Type: – Specifies the email format (plain text, HTML, or multipart with attachments).
Content-Transfer-Encoding: – Shows how content is encoded (Base64, quoted-printable, etc.).
MIME Boundary: – Separates multiple parts of an email (plain text vs. HTML or attachments).
➡️ Used to detect hidden payloads or extra HTML content that doesn’t appear in the plain-text view.


Red Flags
• Organization name mismatch.
• Awkward greetings or inconsistent sender identity.
• Social engineering tactics (urgency, fear, pressure, or authority).
• Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or formatting inconsistencies.

Encoding Types (Common Obfuscation Techniques)
• Base64 Encoding: – Encodes attachments or hides scripts within HTML or MIME parts.
• HTML Entity Encoding: – Masks malicious code or links inside HTML text.
• URL Encoding: – Hides phishing URLs or redirects inside encoded characters (%2E, %2F, etc.).


CyberChef: – Decode and analyze encoded content.
• Decode Base64 strings to reveal hidden data.
• Deobfuscate encoded URLs or HTML entities.
• Visualize and extract hidden scripts or payloads.


- Email Content Analysis Examples -

• Hiding Malicious URLs within Legitimate-Looking Links Example: 
<a href="https://malicious-site.com">https://legitimate-site.com</a>

• URL Encoding Example:
https://malicious-site.com/badstuff
https://malicious-site.com/%62%61%64%73%74%75%66

• Base64 Encoding Example:

-- Email URL Analysis -- 

Email URL Analysis is the process of examining links found in emails to detect signs of phishing, malicious redirects, or other security risks.

Domain Name: – Check spelling, typos, special characters, or extra subdomains.
Redirects: – Identify short URLs or multi-hop redirects that hide the real site.
Registration Details: – Use WHOIS to see domain age, registrar, and ownership.
SSL Certificate: – Verify the certificate issuer, validity, and domain match.
Hosting IP: – Check IP reputation, geolocation, and ASN ownership.
Path and Parameters: – Watch for encoded, obfuscated, or long random strings.
Protocol Used: – HTTP vs HTTPS; missing HTTPS may indicate fake sites.
Redirection Behavior: – Observe how the site redirects when opened safely.

🔹 Safe Handling of Links
- Never click suspicious links directly.
- Right-click → "Copy Link Location" to inspect safely.
- Always analyze URLs in an isolated or sandboxed environment.

🔹 Using Sublime Text
- Open the .eml file in Sublime Text.
- Search for "http" or "https" to locate embedded URLs.
- Look for <a> tags to reveal hidden or disguised links.
- This method allows visual inspection without activating the URL.

🔹 Using CyberChef
- Tool: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
- Useful operations:
  - "From Quoted Printable" → Decode encoded email content.
  - "Extract URLs" → List all URLs from the message.
  - "Defang URL" → Safely modify links (e.g., hxxps[:] instead of https://).
- Helps decode and examine malicious links securely.
