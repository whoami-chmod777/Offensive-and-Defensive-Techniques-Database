EMAIL FLOW (ASCII)

Sender (Bob)                  Bob's Mail Server                 Alice's Mail Server                 Recipient (Alice)
+-------------+               +-------------------+             +--------------------+              +--------------+
|  Bob        | -- SMTP --->  |  Gmail / SMTP MX  | -- SMTP --> |  Yahoo / SMTP MX   | -- POP3/IMAP|   Alice      |
|  (Sender)   |               |  (outbound MTA)   |             |  (inbound MTA)     | <----------- |  (Recipient) |

Legend:
- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (sending/relaying mail between servers)
- POP3/IMAP: Protocols used by the recipient to retrieve mail from their mail server

Bob (the sender) writes an email and sends it using his mail service (e.g., Gmail).  
Gmail’s server sends the message via SMTP across the internet to Alice’s mail server (e.g., Yahoo).  
Alice then connects to her Yahoo mailbox using POP3 or IMAP to receive and read Bob’s email.


Email Headers: Email headers are lines of metadata attached to an email and contain useful information like sender, receiver, subject, and mail servers.
Email Body: The email body is the main part of the email that the receiver reads and contains the message, links, images, or attachments.
