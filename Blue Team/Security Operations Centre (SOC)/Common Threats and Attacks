Cybersecurity risks that exploit system vulnerabilities, including social engineering, malware, ransomware, and data breaches, posing significant harm to organizations.

-- Social Engineering --

Cyberattacks that exploit human vulnerabilities through deception.

• Exploiting humans
• Spoofing
• Phishing: Spear Phishing, Whaling
• Vishing
• SMiShing (SMS Phishing)
• Quishing (QR Code Phishing)


-- Worm --

Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks, without user interaction.

• Self replicating
• Infect and propagate
• Spreads across networks: Often without requiring user interaction
• Stuxnet, Blaster


-- Spyware/Adware --

Malware designed to monitor user activity and display unwanted advertisements.

• Monitor user activity
• Display unwanted advertisements


-- Trojan --

Malware disguised as legitimate software, used for malicious purposes.

• Disguised malware
• Acting as legitimate software: Games, Extensions, Productivity Applications
• RAT - Remote Access Trojan
• Botnets
• Deliver Ransome


-- Ransomware --

Malware that locks data or systems, demanding payment for restoration.

• Infection
• Demand
• Payment
• Decryption (If you're lucky)


-- Botnet --

A network of compromised systems (zombies) controlled by an attacker to coordinate large-scale cyberattacks.

• Network of compromised "zombies" 
• Controlled by a remote attacker
• Used to coordinate attacks: DDoS, Spam Campaingns, Spread Malware


-- Fileless Malware --
Memory-based malware that leaves no trace on disk, making it harder to detect.

• Memory-based malware
• No traces on disk
• Evade detection and logging 
• Living Off the Land: PowerShell, WMI, Code Injection


-- Identity and Account Compromise --

The theft or misuse of credentials (usernames, passwords) and personal information.

• Usernames, passwords, SSN, PII
• Impersonation, fraud, theft
• Methods include: Phishing, Brute Force, Credential Stuffing, Social Engineering, Malware


-- Insider Threats --

Threats originating from within an organization, often from employees, contractors, or partners.

• Threats from the "inside": Current or Former Employees, Contractors, Partners
• Malicious, careless, or compromised
• Can lead to severe exposure and damage: Data breaches, IP Theft, Reputational Damage, Legal issues


-- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTS) --

Highly skilled adversaries using sophisticated techniques for long-term, targeted attacks.

• Highly skilled, well funded adversaries
• Sophisticated
• Persistent: Long-term, quiet, and undetected access
• Targeted
• Strategic Objectives

-- Denial-of-Service Attacks --

Attacks aimed at disrupting the availability of systems by overwhelming them with traffic.

• Disrupt the availability of systems
• Flood of traffic and requests: Exhaust a system's resources and bandwidth
• Intentional or Accidental
• Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDoS): Utilize multiple compromised systems, Amplification, Hard to defend and block


-- Data Breaches --

Incidents involving the exposure, theft, or compromise of sensitive data.

• Data exposure, theft, or compromise
• PII, credentials, financial records, IP
• Malicious actions and human error: Misconfiguration, Inadequate security controls
• Reputational Damage, Regulatory Trouble


-- Zero-Days --

Exploits targeting vulnerabilities that are unknown and unpatched by the vendor.

• Vulnerabilities previously unknown to a vendor
• No patches, no mitigations: Zero days to patch, Zero days to protect
• Risk mitigation, risk avoidance


-- Supply Chain Attacks --

Cyberattacks targeting vulnerabilities in third-party suppliers or vendors, affecting downstream systems.

• Exploits up the chain: Compromises security downstream 
• Suppliers, vendors, partners
• Malware propagates down: Hard to detect, Malware from "trusted" entities
