Information Security Refresher: Strengthening Your Security Foundations

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, it’s crucial to revisit and reinforce the fundamentals that protect our information systems. Here’s a quick refresher on some core concepts:

-- CIA Triad --

• Confidentiality: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
• Integrity: Ensure data remains accurate and trustworthy.
• Availability: Make sure data and resources are accessible when needed.

-- AAA Framework --

• Authentication: Verify who’s accessing your systems.
• Authorization: Define what actions are allowed based on roles and permissions.
• Accounting: Track and log activities for monitoring and auditing.

-- Understanding Security Risks --

• Vulnerabilities: Weak points that could be exploited by threats.
• Threats: Potential dangers like malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks.
• Risk: The likelihood and potential impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

-- Logs, Events, and Incidents --

• Logs: Records of system activities, crucial for troubleshooting and security.
• Security Events: Observations that might impact security.
• Security Incidents: Events that actually harm or compromise your systems.

-- Security Controls --

• Defense in Depth: Implement multiple layers of security.
• Administrative Controls: Policies, incident response plans, and change management.
• Technical Controls: Firewalls, EDR, IDS, and two-factor authentication.
• Physical Controls: Access control systems, cameras, and biometrics.

-- Control Functions --

• Preventative: Stop attacks before they happen (e.g., firewalls, ACLs).
• Detective: Identify intrusions (e.g., IDS, SIEM).
• Corrective: Limit damage from attacks (e.g., backups, patch management).
• Deterrent: Discourage attackers (e.g., physical barriers, signage).

-- Risk Control Strategies --

• Risk Transference: Shift risk to third parties (e.g., insurance, cloud services).
• Risk Acceptance: Tolerate known risks.
• Risk Avoidance: Eliminate exposure to risks (e.g., limit data storage).
• Risk Mitigation: Reduce the likelihood or impact of risks.

-- Key Security Policies --

• Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): Define what’s allowed within your organization.
• Password Policy: Set rules for password creation and management.
• Data Classification Policy: Categorize data by sensitivity.
• Change Management Policy: Plan and control system changes.
• Disaster Recovery Policy: Prepare for recovering systems and data after incidents.

Staying sharp on these fundamentals helps ensure that our security posture remains strong in the face of evolving threats.
