-- What Education Does a Threat Hunter Need? --

If you made it this far, you are probably interested in learning about the educational pathway for becoming a threat hunter. Formal education via Universities (Computer Science), programming, or information security (experience/training) can provide a strong foundation for the threat hunter role. Given the skill shortage within cybersecurity, some employers have lowered how strict the current requirements are for cybersecurity positions—the infamous laundry list. This act is making hiring decisions more stable and helps place more focus on technical aptitude, soft skills, and on-the-job experience.
Certifications—especially with training—are another avenue for students to verify their skills, learn cyber tools, and increase their employability within the market. Albeit, experience will always trump certifications, this is a great way to learn more about the field without being employed per se. Employers place a heavy weight on the ability of candidates who demonstrate hands-on experience through gamified cyber platforms (HTB, THM, BTLO). These online resources can supplement your formal training after coming from a university or assist you in your career change from a non-IT-related background.

Cybersecurity talent gaps exist across the country. Closing these gaps requires detailed knowledge of the cybersecurity workforce in your region.
