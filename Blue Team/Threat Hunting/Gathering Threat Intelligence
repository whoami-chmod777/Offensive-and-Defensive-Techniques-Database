-- Shodan --

A web search engine for Internet-connected devices and open services. It helps find exposed servers, IoT, and devices across countries or organizations.

https://developer.shodan.io/


-- Resources Providing --

Sites and feeds that publish observable threat data like malicious IPs, hashes, and domains. Use many sources and pull them often to reduce missed threats.

-- IOCs --

Indicators of Compromise such as IPs, domains, file hashes, and C2 addresses used to detect and block attacks. Collect IOCs from many sources and apply whitelists/filters to lower false positives.

-- Hacker Forums --

Online communities where threat actors post about planned attacks, sales of access, and tools. Monitoring these posts can reveal attack direction, targets, and methods.


-- Ransomware Blogs

Sites where ransomware groups publish victim data and announcements. These help track which groups target which organizations and countries. Onion directories (Tor required)

https://www.torproject.org/


-- Black Markets

Marketplaces selling stolen data, RDP access, credit card dumps, and logs. They often require scripted scraping because APIs are usually not available.


-- Chatters

Messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord, IRC, ICQ) where threat actors share files, sell access, and coordinate. Monitor chats and record relevant posts for intel.

https://web.telegram.org/a/
https://discord.com/


-- Code Repositories

Public Git repositories may contain leaked credentials, API keys, or exploit code left accidentally. Use targeted searches (dorks) to find sensitive data and uploaded exploits.

https://github.com/
https://about.gitlab.com/


-- File Share Websites

Anonymous file hosting sites used to distribute stolen documents and data. Files often become indexed and can be discovered via dorking and automated scripts.

-- Public Buckets

Cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage) unintentionally left public, exposing sensitive files. Brute-force and name-list techniques can discover such buckets for review.

-- Honeypots

Intentionally vulnerable systems that attract attackers so you can collect attacker IPs, tools, and behavior. Deploy or use public honeypots to gather fresh IOCs for your defenses.
Examples/technologies: Kippo, Glastopf, ElasticHoney (search project pages on GitHub)


-- SIEM / IDS / IPS / Firewalls

Your internal security logs and blocked alerts are a primary intelligence source. Extract blocked IPs, hashes, and alerts from these products to stay one step ahead of attackers.
