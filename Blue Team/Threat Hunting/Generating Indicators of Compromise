-- File Property Indicators --

There are two ways we can get a file’s size; using the GUI, or using the command-line.

Retrieving File Size Property:

View the properties pane: right-click > properties > size value
# ls -lh 
# ls -lha

Retrieving File Name Property:

View the properties pane: right-click > properties > Name value
# ls


-- File Hash Indicators --

A hash is a unique string value that corresponds to the contents of the file. They are generated by hashing algorithms, such as Message Digest 5 (MD5) or Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256). If two files are exactly the same, the hash will match. But if even one character is different, the files will have unique hash values (we'll show you this in a second!).

Generating a Checksum

md5sum TextFile1.txt
sha256sum TextFile1.txt

Get-FileHash TextFile1.txt
Get-FileHash -algorithm md5 TextFile1.txt
Get-FileHash -algorithm sha256sum TextFile1.txt
