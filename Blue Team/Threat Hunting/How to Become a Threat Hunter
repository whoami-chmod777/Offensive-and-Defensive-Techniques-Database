-- How Can I Become a Threat Hunter? --

An interest and some passion for cybersecurity can take you far. Many threat hunters participate in industry-wide events, data-sharing arrangements, and conferences with other public and private-sector analysts to stay abreast of cyber threatsâ€”especially from advanced persistent threats (APTs). You as an aspiring threat hunter should do the same!
Most organizations are looking for cyber threat hunters to have a solid foundation as cybersecurity analysts. The experience barrier is a huge deterrent for career-switchers but remember, threat hunting is a mid to senior-level role within cybersecurity. These professionals often rise through the ranks of junior roles to fill these positions. One example of a junior role is a SOC Analyst. A junior SOC analyst is one of the primary entry-level roles within cybersecurity. Professionals in these roles are responsible for monitoring, investigating, and reporting incidents from security information and events management (SIEM) systems. They also monitor firewall, web, email, and DNS logs to identify and mitigate intrusion attempts. With this background, professionals are quickly able to work through the cyber threat hunting process and large amounts of data to identify real threats and quickly eliminate them.
