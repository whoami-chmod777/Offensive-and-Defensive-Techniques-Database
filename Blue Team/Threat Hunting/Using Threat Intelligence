üß† Extended Cyber Intelligence Cheat Sheet (XTI Structure)

After interpreting collected data with the attack surface, it becomes usable Threat Intelligence (TI). TI is applied in 3 areas:

‚Ä¢ External Attack Surface Management (EASM)
‚Ä¢ Digital Risk Protection (DRP)
‚Ä¢ Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Together they form XTI (Extended Threat Intelligence) ‚Äî each consumes and uses intelligence differently.


üåê External Attack Surface Management (EASM)

EASM manages and monitors an organization‚Äôs external assets (domains, IPs, servers, etc.). It detects unknown or forgotten assets and alerts when something changes or becomes risky.

Key Alerts & Meanings:

‚Ä¢ New Digital Asset(s) Detected ‚Äî A new domain/IP is found. Verify if it belongs to your organization.
‚Ä¢ Domain Information Change Detected ‚Äî WHOIS info changed. Compare old/new data and confirm it‚Äôs authorized.
‚Ä¢ DNS Information Change Detected ‚Äî DNS records modified. Check if it‚Äôs a legitimate or malicious change.
‚Ä¢ DNS Zone Transfer Detected ‚Äî DNS zone transfer seen. Review configuration and confirm it‚Äôs expected.
‚Ä¢ Internal IP Address Detected ‚Äî Internal IP exposed in public DNS. Contact DNS team to fix it.
‚Ä¢ Critical Open Port Detected ‚Äî Port exposed via Shodan or scan data. Verify use or close it.
‚Ä¢ SMTP Open Relay Detected ‚Äî Mail server allows open relay. Confirm settings with mail admin.
‚Ä¢ SPF/DMARC Record Not Found ‚Äî Missing email security records. Configure SPF and DMARC correctly.
‚Ä¢ SSL Certificate Revoked/Expired ‚Äî SSL expired or revoked. Renew immediately to avoid insecure communication.
‚Ä¢ Suspicious Website Redirection ‚Äî Domain redirects to unknown site. Check for compromise.
‚Ä¢ Subdomain Takeover Detected ‚Äî Subdomain hijacked. Investigate DNS and fix ownership.
‚Ä¢ Website Status Code Changed ‚Äî Website returns different HTTP code. Check for downtime or error.
‚Ä¢ Vulnerability Detected ‚Äî CVE or scan found on asset. Validate, patch, or update service quickly.

üõ°Ô∏è Digital Risk Protection (DRP)

Digital Risk Protection (DRP) maps all collected data to the organization‚Äôs assets. It protects brand reputation, prevents fraud, and monitors Deep & Dark Web threats.

Key Alerts & Meanings:

‚Ä¢ Potential Phishing Domain Detected ‚Äî Domain looks similar to yours. Inspect safely and request takedown if fake.
‚Ä¢ Rogue Mobile Application Detected ‚Äî Fake or copied mobile app found. Analyze APK, remove malicious version.
‚Ä¢ IP Address Reputation ‚Äî IP blacklisted or seen in bad activity. Investigate, clean, and restore reputation.
‚Ä¢ Impersonating Social Media Account Detected ‚Äî Fake account mimics brand. Report and request removal.
‚Ä¢ Botnet Detected at Black Market ‚Äî Your IP/domain in botnet data. Isolate, investigate, and reset credentials.
‚Ä¢ Suspicious Content Detected at Deep & Dark Web ‚Äî Mention of your org on forums or leaks. Analyze and prepare defense.
‚Ä¢ Suspicious Content Detected at IM Platforms ‚Äî Telegram/IRC chat mentions your org. Review context and act fast.
‚Ä¢ Stolen Credit Card Detected ‚Äî Card data seen in dark web sale. Notify fraud team and cancel card.
‚Ä¢ Data Leak Detected on Code Repository ‚Äî Sensitive data found on GitHub/S3/etc. Delete or request takedown immediately.
‚Ä¢ Company Info Detected on Malware Analysis Service ‚Äî File sample mentions your org. Analyze sample and take action.
‚Ä¢ Employee or VIP Credential Detected ‚Äî Leaked employee credentials found. Enforce password reset and security review.

üîç Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

CTI tracks global cyber threats, ransomware trends, offensive IPs, and new attack campaigns. It provides context and awareness to strengthen proactive defense.

Usage:

‚Ä¢ Integrate CTI feeds into SIEM, SOAR, and EDR tools.
‚Ä¢ Combine external intel with internal logs for best accuracy.
‚Ä¢ Monitor ongoing threat actor activities and vulnerabilities.
