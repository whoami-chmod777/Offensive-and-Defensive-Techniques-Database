-- The Cyber Kill Chain (Detailed) --

• Reconnaissance: Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.
• Weaponization: Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
• Delivery: Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
• Exploitation: Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim’s system
• Installation: Installing malware on the asset
• Command & Control (C2): Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
• Actions on Objectives: With “Hands on Keyboard” access, intruders accomplish their original goals


-- The Unified Kill Chain --

#  | Attack Phase           | Description
---|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
01 | Reconnaissance         | Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.                  |
02 | Resource Development   | Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack.                  |
03 | Delivery               | Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.            |
04 | Social Engineering     | Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.                               |
05 | Exploitation           | Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution.    |
06 | Persistence            | Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.      |
07 | Defense Evasion        | Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.           |
08 | Command & Control      | Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.         |
09 | Pivoting               | Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible.        |
10 | Discovery              | Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.         |
11 | Privilege Escalation   | The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.       |
12 | Execution              | Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.            |
13 | Credential Access      | Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.          |
14 | Lateral Movement       | Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.            |
15 | Collection             | Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.                |
16 | Exfiltration           | Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.                       |
17 | Impact                 |Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.                  |
18 | Objectives             |Socio-technical objectives of an attack that are intended to achieve a strategic goal.                   |
