[ Infrastructure ] <--- Deployed Via ---> [ Capability ]
   Infected USB drives                      - 4 Zero day exploits
                                            - Automatic worm execution
   Uses                                     - Rootkits
                                            - Stolen certificates
                        |                   - Malware to sabotage centrifuges
                        |
                        v Exploits
                     [ Victim ]
                  Iran's nuclear program


This keeps the diamond shape logic:

• Adversary on top
• Infrastructure on the left
• Capability on the right
• Victim at the bottom
• Arrows showing relationships
