-- What is Vulnerability Management --    

Vulnerability Management is the process of identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities in software, reporting on these so they can be fixed, with a goal of reducing the risk and impact of cyber-attacks. This is a very important aspect of network and computer security, as it works to reduce the attack surface, a term used to describe the number of potential security flaws a malicious actor could exploit to cause harm to an organization. The process includes the following steps: 

- Identification – Using vulnerability scanners, manual techniques, and asset discovery methods to identify and record systems (such as servers, desktops, laptops, mobiles, IoT devices), along with any security issues they have, with scores based on different factors (see CVSS scores).
- Reporting – Reporting these issues to appropriate stakeholders (such as system owners) so they can be addressed, and eventually resolved.
- Remediation – Having the security issues fixed by the system owner or technical owner so that the security flaw is no longer present. Different methods can be used to remediate vulnerabilities, such as security patches, reconfigurations, or mitigating controls.
- Reassessment – Scanning or manually checking to ensure the security issues have been successfully fixed.
 
This is a cyclic process, so assets should routinely be scanned, especially after major changes. Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities quickly means malicious actors have less time to discover and exploit them.


-- Associated Roles --

The below roles generally contain work that includes aspects of Vulnerability Management, such as vulnerability scanning, knowledge of exploitation, and system hardening:
 
Threat Intelligence Analyst
Receiving and reporting on intelligence about newly released vulnerabilities, or vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited in the wild, and by which threat actors. Intelligence Analysts will usually have access to commercial tools that allow them to observe exploitation activity on a global scale, as well as underground discussions about vulnerabilities, helping the Vulnerability Analysts to prioritize which issues need to be fixed first.
 
Vulnerability Analyst
Identifying, reporting on, and helping to remediate vulnerable assets to harden the estate and reduce risk from cyber-attacks. Daily tasks include vulnerability scanning, analyzing results, performing manual checks, reporting on security flaws, and keeping up-to-date with the latest publicly available news regarding vulnerabilities, as well as receiving threat intelligence reports from Intelligence Analysts.
 
Incident Responder
Knowledge about vulnerabilities, and how to deal with compromises as a result of successful exploitation is key in knowing how to respond in the most effective way.
 
Penetration Tester / Red Teamer
Knowing how to identify and scan for vulnerabilities and security flaws is key to this role, allowing you to exploit systems and gain access for security purposes, reporting on these so that Vulnerability Analysts can work with stakeholders to get the systems remediated.


-- Building a Career in Vulnerability Management --

To start, it’s worth mentioning that this is all my own opinion, and is not a definitive guide to landing a job as a Vulnerability Analyst. SBT or myself are not endorsed by any companies/websites/services mentioned in this page, they’re just good at what they do. Take this as some friendly advice, based on my experiences and the thoughts of my fellow Analysts.
If you think a Vulnerability Analyst role sounds interesting, and you want to try to land a job in this position, then below is some advice including skills to focus on, experiences to gain, and other ways you can potentially improve your chances. Good luck!

Soft Skills
 
- Communication – This one is super important. You’re going to be communicating with a lot of people in this role, including your own team, the wider security team, stakeholders from essentially every department, management, and even other organizations. You should have a high level of written and verbal communication, and be able to pass technical information to non-technical audiences in a way that they can understand.
- Analytical – You should be analytical, which means you’re good at problem-solving as well as collecting and analyzing information. An example of this is when you receive the output from a vulnerability scanner, you should be able to interpret the results and understand what the report is telling 
  you, so you can work to prioritize remediation.
- Teamwork – This is a pretty obvious one, but as mentioned above you’re potentially going to be working with a lot of people, and you need to be able to work effectively together, in some cases in very pressured and fast-paced situations.
- Time Management – If you’re going to be responsible for conducting vulnerability scans, you need to be very skilled in time management. Not only do you need to find the best time to scan (taking in factors such as operational hours, the sensitivity of systems being scanned, stakeholders that are able to respond if something breaks, and many more), but you’ll also need to make sure you keep everyone updated with vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild, co-ordinating remediation activities (to an extent), and other tasks that require time to be planned efficiently.
 
Security-Related Knowledge
If you haven’t already worked in a security position, there are some things you can do to really boost your knowledge, skills, and look better in a hiring manager’s eyes. For this specific role, the best experiences I can recommend are:

- Getting hands-on with vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, OpenVAS, and Nikto. This shows that you understand how these tools work, how to conduct vulnerability scans, and what their outputs look like. You can get experience like this by downloading the Metasploitable 2 intentionally vulnerable virtual machine (covered later in this course), downloading other vulnerable virtual machines from VulnHub, or scanning machines on penetration testing platforms such as Hack The Box.
- Show that you keep up-to-date with the latest security news, especially surrounding vulnerabilities. You can do this by using platforms such as TweetDeck to monitor for terms such as “vulnerability”, “CVE”, and other phrases that will show tweets regarding vulnerabilities and exploitation (Read my Reddit post about using TweetDeck)
- Have a blog with hacking write-ups, or a Github with custom tools. These will both go a LONG way when trying to get your first job in security, 
  or even move up the ladder. By running a blog, it shows that you are really motivated and driven, something that is very attractive in employees. Writing up how you hacked or ‘owned’ machines on HackTheBox is a great activity, and shows that you understand how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. With custom tools, it shows that you’re a problem solver, and you can create tools to help overcome problems, or speed up tasks. Create your own Github account, clone an open-source tool, and start making your own changes or additions is a great place to start.
