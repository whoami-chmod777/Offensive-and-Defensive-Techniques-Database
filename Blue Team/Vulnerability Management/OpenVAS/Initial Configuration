Before we can start scanning and implementing OpenVAS into our vulnerability management solution we need to do a little bit of maintenance and configuration to get OpenVAS properly working. 
Luckily for us, OpenVAS makes the process very easy and includes a wizard to make the process straightforward. 

Begin by navigating to Scans > Tasks and clicking on the purple magic wand icon to begin the basic configuration wizard. 
We recommend beginning a scan on 127.0.0.1 to test out your installation and ensure it is working properly.

If you successfully navigated to the wizard you should see a pop-up. This is where you will set up your initial scan against your localhost to ensure everything is properly configured.

The scan may take a while to complete, allow OpenVAS enough time to finish the scan, and then you will be met with a new dashboard for monitoring and analyzing your complete and ongoing scans.

Once your scan has finished you can navigate to Scans > Reports and click on your newly created report from your previous task.

If correctly configured you should see three different vulnerabilities reported all originating from OpenVAS itself. This is normal behavior and can be configured/changed to maintain your OpSec.
