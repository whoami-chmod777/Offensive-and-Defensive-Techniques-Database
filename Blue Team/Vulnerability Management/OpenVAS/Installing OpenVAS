--- Installing OpenVAS ---

Install from Kali/OpenVAS repositories



The installation procedure for OpenVAS can vary based on how you decide to install. You can install from Kali/OpenVAS repos, install from source, or run from a docker container. 
The preferred method is to run it inside a docker container as we don't have to worry about a lot of the setup or errors that we may run into with other installation methods.
