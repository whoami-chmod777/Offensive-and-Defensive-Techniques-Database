-- Introduction --

OpenVAS, an application used to scan endpoints and web applications to identify and detect vulnerabilities. It is commonly used by corporations as part of their mitigation solutions to quickly identify any gaps in their production or even development servers or applications. This is not an end all be all solution but can help to get rid of any common vulnerabilities that may have slipped through the cracks.  
From the OpenVAS GitHub repository "This is the Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner (OpenVAS) of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) Solution. It is used for the Greenbone Security Manager appliances and is a full-featured scan engine that executes a continuously updated and extended feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)."


-- GVM Framework Architecture --

OpenVAS is built off the GreenBone Vulnerability Management (GVM) solution and is only one of the appliances that is released from GreenBone. 
OpenVAS is a service within a larger framework of services known as Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM).

A breakdown of the architecture for the GVM framework:

• Vulnerability/Information Feed (NVT, SCAP CERT, User Data, Community Feed)
  ⇒ This section will contain all information and vulnerability tests that come from the Greenbone Community Feed that will be the main baseline for testing against systems.  This can also include User Data provided by the user in place of Greenbone NVTs and SCAP CERTs. 

• Back-End (OSP, OpenVAS, Targets)
  ⇒ The back-end infrastructure is what will be actually conducting all of the vulnerability scanning and processing data and NVTS through OpenVAS and GVM. Greenbone Vulnerability Manager will be the middle man between the scanners and the front-end user interfaces. 

• Front-End (GSA, Web Interfaces)
  ⇒ This is what you interact with when you navigate to OpenVAS in your browser. The web interfaces are built off of the Greenbone Security Assistant and make life easier for an analyst or operator when working with OpenVAS or other forms of scanners through the GVM.
