--- Scanning Infrastructure ---

Now that we know that everything is working we can get into the nitty-gritty of OpenVAS and how it works. 
Deploy the machine and navigate to Scans > Tasks to begin creating a task to scan the provided machine.

• Creating a Task
• Scoping a New Target


-- Creating a Task --

To create a configurable task navigate to the star icon in the upper right-hand corner of the Tasks dashboard and select New Task. 
Once you select New Task from the dropdown you will be met with a large pop-up with many options.

For this task, we will be focusing only on the Name, Scan Targets, and Scanner Type, and Scan Config. 
In later tasks, we will be focusing on the other options for more advanced configuration and implementation/automation.

1. Name: Allows us to set the name the scan will be known as inside of OpenVAS
2. Scan Targets: The targets to scan, can include Hosts, Ports, and Credentials. To create a new target you will need to follow another pop-up.
3. Scanner: The scanner to use by default will use the OpenVAS architecture however you can set this to any scanner of your choosing in the settings menu.
4. Scan Config: OpenVAS has seven different scan types you can select from and will be used based on how you aggressive or what information you want to collect from your scan.


-- Scoping a New Target --

To scope a new target, navigate to the star icon next to Scan Targets.
Above is the menu for configuring a new target. The two main options you will need to configure are the Name and the Hosts. 
This procedure is fairly straight forward and other options will only be used in advanced vulnerability management solutions. 
Now that we have our target scoped we can continue to create our task and begin the scan.
Once you create the task you will be brought back to the scan dashboard where you can monitor and start your task. To start the task navigate to the start icon under Actions.
