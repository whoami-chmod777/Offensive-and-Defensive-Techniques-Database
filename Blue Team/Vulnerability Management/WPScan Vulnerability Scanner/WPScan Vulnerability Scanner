WPScan Vulnerability Scanner                                                                                                                   
WPScan is a free (non-commercial) black box WordPress vulnerability scanner. Over one-third of ALL websites use WordPress. That’s a huge amount. So for site owners, this tool is great to identify any security flaws in the many features that WordPress allows, such as Plugins (3rd Part Extensions), Themes (Appearance Templates), and Users. Unfortunately it’s not easy to get hands-on with this tool, as there are no sites hosted on the internet that expressively allow scanning (whereas sites like scanme.nmap.org are designed for tool testing).

Introduction to WordPress
If you’re new to WordPress, you need to know about the three main features these sites have, as we’ll be scanning for issues with them using WPScan. Below you’ll learn about WordPress Plugins, Themes, and Users.

WordPress Plugins
Plugins are pieces of software that can be added to a site to provide additional functionality, such as different site editors, the ability to create forms, edit registration pages, add security monitoring, and much more! WordPress will usually make use of quite a few plugins in order to achieve the type of site they want. Unfortunately, plugins that are created by small teams or are rarely updated can pose security risks, the same with any type of software that isn’t properly maintained or secured. Vulnerabilities can be discovered which could allow a malicious actor to damage the site that is running the plugin. Below is a screenshot showing a number of WordPress Plugins, and their descriptions.

WordPress Themes
Themes are a combination of templates and stylesheets, that changes how a site looks. WordPress Themes can be vulnerable in the same way Plugins can suffer from security flaws. If WPScan discovers a vulnerable theme, it should be 
updated to the next version to fix the issue, or should be removed to prevent a malicious actor from exploiting the flaw. This can become complicated when sites are developed using a number of different themes for pages, potentially increasing the attack surface. It is advised to use popular themes that are regularly updated by their development team. 

WordPress Users
WordPress can allow for user registration so that members of your site can access specific areas and then access them on demand. As with any service where accounts are involved, there is the potential for a malicious actor to gain access to them. This would typically be done via password brute-forcing or social engineering. If an attacker knows the usernames of accounts, it makes this process a lot easier, as they now only need to guess the password. We can use WPScan to see if the target site is leaking any usernames which could be abused.

Let's conducting a vulnerability scan against https://securityred.team, which is hosted within an AWS VPC (Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud). 

DO NOT scan any site unless you have permission, otherwise this is illegal activity.

Test 1: Basic Security Scan – We’re going to start off by launching a basic scan, without any specific parameters. This will identify any generic security issues. We’ll use the command wpscan --url http://securityred.team
The tool will output verbosely in real-time, so we can see the results as they come in

Interesting finds:
