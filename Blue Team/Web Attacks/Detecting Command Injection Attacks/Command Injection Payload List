-- Command Injection Payload List --

Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.
This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code injection allows the attacker to add his own code that is then executed by the application. In Command Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application, which execute system commands, without the necessity of injecting code.


-- What is OS command injection --

OS command Injection is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to gain complete control over an affected web site and the underlying web server.
OS command injection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user data into an operating system command that it executes. An attacker can manipulate the data to cause their own commands to run. This allows the attacker to carry out any action that the application itself can carry out, including reading or modifying all of its data and performing privileged actions.
In addition to total compromise of the web server itself, an attacker can leverage a command injection vulnerability to pivot the attack in the organization's internal infrastructure, potentially accessing any system which the web server can access. They may also be able to create a persistent foothold within the organization, continuing to access compromised systems even after the original vulnerability has been fixed.
