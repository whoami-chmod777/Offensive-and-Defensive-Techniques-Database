Of course itâ€™s not possible to detect or analyze web server logs without using automated detection methods. For an easier way, any SOC analyst can use the following regex to detect open redirection attacks. 

/^.*"GET.*\?.*=(https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]+%2e[a-z]{2,}).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm

This regex will match any log entry where the HTTP method is GET, the request contains a query parameter with https://x.com, and the request is using HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1. This should match the most common open redirection attack patterns.
You can customize this regex to match specific query parameters or HTTP methods that are relevant to your web application. Remember that this regex is just one part of an overall security monitoring strategy and should be used in conjunction with other security tools and best practices
