-- Detecting Open Redirection Attacks --

This regex will match any log entry where the HTTP method is GET, the request contains a query parameter with https://x.com, and the request is using HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1. This should match the most common open redirection attack patterns.

üîç Regex Explanation: /^.*"GET.*\?.*=(https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]+%2e[a-z]{2,}).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm

‚úÖ Using grep: grep -E '^.*"GET.*\?.*=(%2e%2e%2f).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$' access.log
‚úÖ Using grep -P (Perl Regex): grep -Pi '"GET.*\?.*=(https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]+%2e[a-z]{2,}).*HTTP\/.*"' /var/log/nginx/access.log
‚úÖ Using awk: awk 'tolower($0) ~ /get.*\?.*=https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]+%2e[a-z]{2,}.*http\// { print $0 }' /var/log/nginx/access.log
‚úÖ Using sed: sed -n '/https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]*%2e[a-z][a-z]*/Ip' /var/log/nginx/access.log
‚úÖ Extended Matching: grep -Pi '(https%3a%2f%2f|https:\/\/|http:\/\/|https%253a%252f%252f)[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}' /var/log/nginx/access.log
‚úÖ Highlight Matches: grep -Pi --color=always '(https%3a%2f%2f|https:\/\/|http:\/\/|https%253a%252f%252f)[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}' /var/log/nginx/access.log



-- Detecting Directory Traversal Attacks --

These are really basic payloads for directory traversal attacks. So, we should keep in mind ../ (dot dot slash), encoded and double encoded ../ is the key values for this attack type. Here is the basic example for detecting these payloads on nginx access.log file;

Linux
/etc/issue
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/group
/etc/hosts


Windows
c:/boot.ini
c:/inetpub/logs/logfiles
c:/inetpub/wwwroot/global.asa
c:/inetpub/wwwroot/index.asp
c:/inetpub/wwwroot/web.config
c:/sysprep.inf
