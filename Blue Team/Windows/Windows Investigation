-- How to protect against MBR Rootkit Attacks --

1. Keep the operating system and security software up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
2. Use strong, unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access to the system.
3. Employ full-disk encryption to protect the MBR from modification by unauthorized parties.
4. Regularly scan for malware and rootkits using reputable security software.
5. Be cautious when downloading and executing software from untrusted sources, as this is a common way rootkits gain access to a system.
6. Periodically check the integrity of the MBR to ensure it hasn't been tampered with. Some tools can help with this task.
