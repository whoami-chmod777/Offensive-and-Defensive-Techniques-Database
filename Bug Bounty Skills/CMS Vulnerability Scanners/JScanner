JScanner is a vulnerability scanner that can analyze remote Joomla CMS installations using several different techniques. 
It is written in python and apart from identifying vulnerabilities, it can also perform user enumeration.
Apart from vulnerability scanning, JScanner can also perform user enumeration. This works, however, only if the user registration function is enabled on the target Joomla site.


python jscanner.py analyze -u targetsite.com
python jscanner.py enumerate -u http://targetsite.com -U users.txt
