WPForce is a collection of WordPress attack tools with another unique set of capabilities. Currently it contains these 2 python scripts:

• wpforce.py – admin login brute force tool (stealth via WordPress API)
• yertle.py – backdoor shell upload with a number of post exploitation modules

First we have to find valid login credentials to the target WordPress site by performing brute force login attack with wpforce.py.
Once we find valid credentials with wpforce.py, we can then use the yertle.py script for the post exploitation tasks.

This is what we can do with the yertle.py script:

• Upload an interactive system shell
• Spawn a full featured reverse shell
• Dump WordPress password hashes
• Backdoor authentication functions to capture plain text passwords
• Inject BeEF hook into all pages and attack the website’s visitors
• Pivot to meterpreter if needed



python wpforce.py -i users.txt -w pwdlist.txt -u "http://www.targetsite.com"
python yertle.py -u admin -p password -t https://targetsite.com/ --interactive
