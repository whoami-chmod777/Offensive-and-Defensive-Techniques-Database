In web applications, file and directory scanning is a method commonly used by security professionals. This process involves querying the underlying file and directory structure of web applications. 
The goal is to uncover hidden files, administrative panels, backup files, and directories potentially containing sensitive information.

There are many tools available for file and directory scanning, including gobuster and ffuf

➜ Gobuster dir Mode

Let's examine the dir mode of the gobuster tool, which we can use for directory scanning.

# gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

➜ Directory Scanning

Let's perform a directory scan on a target system with the command below. We specify the wordlist with the -w parameter and the target with the -u parameter. In this scan, we used the directory-list-1.0.txt list as the wordlist.

# gobuster dir -u 172.20.8.56 -w /root/Desktop/misc/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt

➜ File/Page Scanning

et's perform a file/page scan on a target system with the command below. We specify the wordlist with the -w parameter, the target with the -u parameter, and the extensions with the --extensions parameter. 
The -v parameter is used for verbose output. Let's use the following command to detect files with the .php extension.

# gobuster dir -u 172.20.8.56 -w /root/Desktop/misc/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt --extensions php -v
