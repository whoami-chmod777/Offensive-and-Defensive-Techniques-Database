--- Information Gathering in Web Applications ---

We'll focused on the information gathering process, which is a crucial first step in cybersecurity. 
This post will covers active and passive information gathering techniques, providing foundational knowledge about different methods and tools that can be used to assess the security posture of a target. 
Active information gathering involves direct interaction with the target, while passive information gathering involves collecting information about the target without its knowledge.

The detailed topics include Whois queries, identifying technologies used on target websites, using the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine), advanced search techniques like Google Dorks, metadata analysis, DNS enumeration, discovery tools like theHarvester, subdomain enumeration, and file and directory scanning methods. 

These topics provide a comprehensive guide to methodologies and tools that are useful when testing the security of a web application or conducting cybersecurity research.

-- Introduction --

We will learn the fundamental ways, techniques, and tools for gathering detailed information about a website. 
Information gathering enables cybersecurity professionals to understand attack surfaces, identify potential weaknesses, and develop attack/defense strategies. 
This process is generally examined under two main categories: "active information gathering" and "passive information gathering."

➜ Active Information Gathering

This approach involves direct interaction with the target system. Queries sent or requests made during the information gathering process can be detected by the target system and may leave traces. 
Therefore, active information gathering methods are commonly considered more aggressive and should be conducted carefully.

➜ Passive Information Gathering

Passive information gathering is performed without direct interaction with the target system. 
These methods allow for gathering information about the target without leaving traces on the system, making the process much more covert. 
Passive information gathering methods include WHOIS queries, social media analysis, and the examination of third-party databases.
