-- Getting Started --

Upon starting Burp Suite, users are presented with a project and configuration interface that allows them to create a new project or load an existing one. 
This interface serves as a starting point to define the working environment and configure the settings of the tools to be used in Burp Suite.


-- Project Type Interface --

When starting Burp Suite, you need to choose one of three basic project types offered:

• Temporary Project: This option allows you to quickly start a project without leaving any trace on the disk. In this mode, all data is stored in RAM and is erased when Burp Suite is closed.
• New Project: Allows you to start a project from scratch by configuring advanced project settings as well as basic information like the project's name.
• Open Existing Project: Suitable for loading a previously saved project and continuing from where you left off. By selecting a saved project file, you can quickly access previous work.


-- Configuration Interface --

After selecting the project type, you can configure settings for various modules and tools within Burp Suite. These settings include:

• Use Burp Defaults: This option starts the project using Burp Suite’s default configuration settings.
• Load from Configuration File: This option allows you to select a file containing customized configuration settings and start the project with those settings. It is particularly suitable for advanced users who want to use pre-configured or customized settings for specific testing needs.
