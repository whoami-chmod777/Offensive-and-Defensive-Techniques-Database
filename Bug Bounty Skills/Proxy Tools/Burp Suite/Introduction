Developed by PortSwigger and written in Java, Burp Suite was first released in 2003 as Burp v1.0. 
This tool is used to identify security vulnerabilities in web applications and has become one of the most popular tools preferred by tens of thousands of institutions and experts. 
It provides users with both a graphical interface and access through the terminal, allowing basic functionalities such as capturing and manipulating HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a web browser and a server. 
This functionality is a crucial method frequently used in security testing of web applications. 
Burp Suite supports the process from identifying vulnerabilities to exploiting them, providing users with a seamless experience throughout this process.

PortSwigger offers three different versions of Burp Suite tailored to user needs: Burp Suite Community, Burp Suite Professional, and Burp Suite Enterprise. Among these versions, the Community edition has fewer features compared to the other two and is a suitable starting point for beginners in security testing.
