-- Adding a New Note --

• Add Note: Click on the "Add note" button to add a new note. These notes can contain details about specific findings, important information about a particular feature of the tested application, or potential security vulnerabilities.
• Details: In the opened window, a title and details can be added to the note. Optionally, the note can be assigned to a specific category, making it easier to filter and manage the notes later.


-- Classification --

When right-clicking on an item in the list, various actions can be performed. For example, with the Highlight feature, rows can be color-coded. The Status feature allows you to assign statuses such as New, In Progress, or Done to the items.
