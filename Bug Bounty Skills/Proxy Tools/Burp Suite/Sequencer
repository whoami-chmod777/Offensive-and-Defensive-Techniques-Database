Sequencer is a tool used to test the security of session tokens and other data used in web applications. 
Sequencer analyzes the randomness and unpredictability of these tokens, thereby assessing the likelihood that an attacker could carry out attacks such as session hijacking.

• Capturing Data with Sequencer
• Analysis Process


-- Capturing Data with Sequencer --

1. Capturing Traffic via Proxy: Using Burp Suite's Proxy feature, capture the flow of traffic from the web application. This typically includes token values generated during login processes or other sensitive operations.
2. Sending Data to Sequencer: Right-click on any captured request and choose the "Send to Sequencer" option to send the relevant data to Sequencer.


-- Analysis Process --

1. Token Selection: In the Sequencer interface, select the data you want to analyze. This could be a session token, CSRF token, or other similar data.
2. Data Collection: Sequencer needs to collect a sufficient number of samples to evaluate token security. By clicking the "Start live capture" button, Sequencer starts collecting token samples. For statistically valid results, thousands of samples are typically required.
3. Analysis: Various tests are applied to the collected data to evaluate randomness and unpredictability. Sequencer uses the results of these tests to generate a detailed report on the security of the tokens.
