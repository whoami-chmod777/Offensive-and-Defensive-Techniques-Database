-- What is SCADA --

SCADA systems are the "command centres" of industrial operations. They act as the bridge between human operators and the machines doing the work. 
Think of SCADA as the nervous system of a factory—it senses what's happening, processes that information, and sends commands to make things happen.


-- Components of a SCADA System --

A SCADA system typically consists of four key components:

1. Sensors & actuators: These are the eyes and hands of the system. Sensors measure real-world conditions, such as temperature, pressure, position, and weight. Actuators perform physical actions—motors turn, valves open, robotic arms move. 
2. PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers): These are the brains that execute automation logic. They read sensor data, make decisions based on programmed rules, and send commands to actuators. 
3. Monitoring systems: Visual interfaces like CCTV cameras, dashboards, and alarm panels where operators observe physical processes. 
4. Historians: Databases that store operational data for later analysis. Every package loaded, every drone launched, every system change gets recorded. This historical data helps identify patterns, troubleshoot problems, and—in incident response scenarios like ours—reconstruct what an attacker did.


-- Why SCADA Systems Are Targeted --

Industrial control systems, such as SCADA, have become increasingly attractive targets for cybercriminals and nation-state actors. Here's why:

• They often run legacy software with known vulnerabilities. Many SCADA systems were installed decades ago and never updated. Security patches that exist for modern software don't exist for these ageing systems.
• Default credentials are commonly left unchanged. Administrators prioritise keeping systems running over changing passwords. In industrial environments, the mentality is often "if it works, don't touch it"—a recipe for security disasters.
• They're designed for reliability, not security. Most SCADA systems were built before cyber security was a significant concern. They were intended for closed networks that were presumed safe. Authentication, encryption, and access controls were afterthoughts at best.
• They control physical processes. Unlike attacking a website or stealing data, compromising SCADA systems has real-world consequences. Attackers can cause blackouts, contaminate water supplies, or—in our case—sabotage Christmas deliveries.
• They're often connected to corporate networks. The myth of "air-gapped" industrial systems is largely fiction. Most SCADA systems connect to business networks for reporting, remote management, and data integration. This connectivity provides attackers with entry points.
• Protocols like Modbus lack authentication. Many industrial protocols were designed for trusted environments. Anyone who can reach the Modbus port (502) can read and write values without proving their identity.

In early 2024, the first ICS/OT malware, FrostyGoop, was discovered. The malware can directly interface with industrial control systems via the Modbus TCP protocol, enabling arbitrary reads and writes to device registers over TCP port 502.
