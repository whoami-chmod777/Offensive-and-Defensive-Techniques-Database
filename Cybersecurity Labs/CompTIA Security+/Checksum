A checksum is a value derived from the digital data of a file or message that is used to verify the integrity of the data. The purpose of a checksum is to ensure that the data has not been altered or corrupted during transmission or storage. Checksums are generated through different algorithms, with the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHAs) and the MD5 algorithm standing out as the two most widely used methods. Websites often provide checksums alongside downloadable files as a means for users to independently verify the integrity of the file they are downloading. Users can calculate the checksum of the downloaded file and compare it to the provided checksum on the website. If the checksums match, it suggests that the file has not been corrupted or compromised, providing a level of confidence in the file's integrity.


Objective: Verify the integrity of the downloaded Ubuntu MATE ISO file (ubuntu-mate-22.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso) if the SHA256 checksum of this file mentioned on the website is d84cd3eb7732fbb39ce3cd24ba1b302a643fe0362f7ac9261fc4c7b756e42a55.

• Task 1: Using Command Line
• Task 2: Using GtkHash (GUI)

Tools
• sha256sum
• GtkHash


In this lab exercise, we confirmed the integrity of the downloaded Ubuntu MATE ISO file by verifying the checksum from the command line as well as using the GtkHash GUI.

Step 1: Open the lab link to access the ubuntu machine

Step 2: Navigate to Downloads where the downloaded Ubuntu MATE ISO file is present.

Step 3: At the time of this writing, the SHA256 checksum of the given ISO file as mentioned on the website is d84cd3eb7732fbb39ce3cd24ba1b302a643fe0362f7ac9261fc4c7b756e42a55.


>> Task 1: Using Command Line <<

Step 4: Save the checksum mentioned on the website to a file named SHA256.txt using the following command: echo "d84cd3eb7732fbb39ce3cd24ba1b302a643fe0362f7ac9261fc4c7b756e42a55" > SHA256.txt

Step 5: Next, calculate the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded ISO file using the following command: sha256sum ubuntu-mate-22.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso

This may take a minute or two to run as the file is huge. In case if it takes more than that, stop and rerun the command.

Alternatively, you can use a more general-purpose command: openssl dgst -sha256 ubuntu-mate-22.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso

Grab the generated SHA256 checksum from the terminal and save it to a file named My_SHA256.txt using the following command: echo "d84cd3eb7732fbb39ce3cd24ba1b302a643fe0362f7ac9261fc4c7b756e42a55" > My_SHA256.txt

Step 6: Now, compare the contents of My_SHA256.txt and SHA256.txt (file containing the SHA256 checksum from the website): diff -qs My_SHA256.txt SHA256.txt

The diff command is used to compare two files. The options used in the command are:

• -q: Report only when files differ.
• -s: Report when files are the same.

As observed above, both checksums match, confirming the integrity of the ISO file.


>> Task 2: Using GtkHash (GUI) <<

GtkHash is a free desktop utility for computing message digests or checksums. 

Step 7: You can also verify the checksum using GtkHash. Search for and open GtkHash.
Step 8: Load the Ubuntu MATE ISO file present in Downloads.
Step 9: Copy the SHA256 checksum as mentioned on the website (i.e. d84cd3eb7732fbb39ce3cd24ba1b302a643fe0362f7ac9261fc4c7b756e42a55) and paste it in the Check field.
Step 10: Click on Hash. 

It will take a few seconds to complete. Once it is done, you will see green checkmarks.

This indicates that the provided SHA256 checksum (from the website) matches with the calculated SHA256 checksum, confirming the integrity of the ISO file.
