Keyloggers are a type of malicious software (malware) designed to record and monitor keystrokes on a computer or mobile device. These programs are capable of capturing every keystroke made by a user, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal details. Keyloggers can pose a serious threat to privacy and security, as they enable cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to confidential information.
