Keyloggers are a type of malicious software (malware) designed to record and monitor keystrokes on a computer or mobile device. These programs are capable of capturing every keystroke made by a user, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal details. Keyloggers can pose a serious threat to privacy and security, as they enable cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to confidential information.

In this lab environment, the user will get access to a Windows instance's GUI. Your task is to learn about keyloggers and understand potential risks associated with them by simulating their usage in a controlled environment.

In this lab, we will learn how keyloggers can quietly capture sensitive information by recording every keystroke on a computer. The takeaway is that being aware of these risks and implementing security measures is crucial to protect against potential threats.

Objective: To learn about keyloggers and understand potential risks associated with them by simulating their usage.

The best tools for this lab are: Python, PowerShell and Notepad


Step 1: Open the lab link to access the Windows machine.

Step 2: Navigate to the "C:\Tools" directory. And open the "python-keylogger-main" folder present inside the "C:\Tools" directory.

You can find many open-source keylogger tools on Github. For this lab, we will be using the keylogger script from this open-source github repository: https://github.com/Kalebu/python-keylogger/tree/main

Open the "python-keylogger-main" folder.

Here, you will find the "app.py" file, which is the keylogger script. Since this is a Python script, it requires Python to be installed on the host machine.

Step 3: Copy the path of the current directory and open the powershell in that directory.

Now, open the powershell.

Run the command to move to the "python-keylogger-main" directory: cd "C:\Tools\python-keylogger-main"

Verify the Python installation: python --version

Python 3.12.1 is installed on the system.

Step 5: Open the notepad in another window and run the keylogger script on the powershell. Open the notepad and the powershell side-by-side. 

On PowerShell, run the command given below to start the keylogger: python app.py

Now type "Hello!" on the notepad, and you will notice that, on the powershell, the key logs are getting generated for every key pressed on the keyboard.

Let's open the browser, type something in the search box, and see whether we get key logs or not.

Step 6: Open the Firefox browser and type "www.google.com" inside the search bar.

Now, navigate back to the powershell, and you will notice the logs for each key press have been generated.

Step 7: Close the powershell and open the newly generated "keylogs.txt" file inside the "python-keylogger-main" folder.

Here, you can see all the key logs that have been stored: 
Key.shiftHelloKey.shift!www.google.com

This is how keyloggers can be used to capture sensitive data, like usernames and passwords, from the target computer by logging each keystroke. Whatever the victim is typing on its machine, every log will get stored in a file. The advanced keyloggers have the ability to send that generated log file to the attacker's machine, maybe via email or any other means.
