-- Analyst Note --

On Oct 29, 2020, at 07:34 PM, our SIEM generated an alert for a suspicious Threat Intelligence URL. The identified address, “hxxp[://]115[.]99[.]150[.]132:5684/Mozi[.]m,” was reported as malicious by an external Abuse.ch feed.
Further verification through the Hybrid Analysis sandbox confirmed that the URL was indeed linked to malicious activity, and the IP “115.99.150[.]132” was traced to a source in India.
However, this traffic was part of a controlled internal test for firewall evaluation. The SOC team had been informed in advance to disregard this specific connection. Despite that, the endpoint protection system successfully blocked the attempted communication.
