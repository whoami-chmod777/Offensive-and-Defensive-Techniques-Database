You likely don’t need to access the Dark Web for any reason other than learning about it.
You are not 100% anonymous. Law enforcement agencies around the world monitor the Dark Web, infiltrate forums, and analyse connections to known bad sites. The Dark Web is known for illegal operations as well as explicit material. The sites we are walking you through are legitimate, and should not contain any illegal material, unless they are suddenly compromised, something that is out of our control.

We are not responsible for any actions of students that deviate from the courses’ intended path, which may expose them to illegal images, or other forms of explicit material.

 

Please follow these steps before attempting to access TOR, for your own safety:

    Understand that there is the potential for you to come across offensive or explicit content, and you should be prepared to deal with viewing it.
    As an unregulated part of the internet, there is an increased risk of criminals or hackers trying to steal your data, get you to download malware, or attack your system through the browser. Make sure all software is up-to-date or disabled, such as Flash Player and your browser. Do not click on any links or navigate to any sites if you do not know what they are.
    Ensure you have an updated operating system, including security updates and patches.
    Ensure you have an up-to-date anti-virus solution and it is running.
    We highly recommend that you use a VPN, then use the TOR browser.
