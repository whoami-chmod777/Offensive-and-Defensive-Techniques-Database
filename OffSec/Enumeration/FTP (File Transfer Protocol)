FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. It enables users to upload or download files, manage file directories on a remote server, and navigate the server's file system.

FTP operates on a client-server model, where the client initiates a connection to the server to request files or submit files for storage.

The protocol supports anonymous access, where users can log in with a common username like 'anonymous' or 'ftp', and authenticated access, where a username and password are required.

Default Port: 21
