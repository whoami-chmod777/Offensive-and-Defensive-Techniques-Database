Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol used to securely connect to another computer over a network. 
It allows you to log into another computer, execute commands, and transfer files, all in a secure manner. 
This is because SSH encrypts your connection, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and understand the data being exchanged.
It's commonly used by network administrators to control web servers, by developers to access programming environments, and by anyone needing secure access to a computer over the internet.

Default Port: 22


-- Connect --

ssh username@X.X.X.X
ssh -i path/to/private_key user@target-ip

Install PuTTY and run it then enter target IP address and port(22 by default) also choose to connect type as SSH.
