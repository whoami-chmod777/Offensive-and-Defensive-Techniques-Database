We will be learning how to exploit the vulnerabilities that we discovered in the enumeration phase and through our vulnerability assessment. We will focus on using scripts in different languages, compiled exploits, Metasploit, password cracking tools and, where applicable, we will also exploit vulnerabilities manually. The ultimate objective in the exploitation phase is to get a root/system/administrator shell on the various hosts in the VHL lab network.

Before we can start with exploiting vulnerable services we will have to know where we can find exploits, how to modify them based on the target and optionally how to compile and transfer them to the target. 

You have to learn how:

• Find exploits using online and offline resources.
• Analyse and modify existing exploit code.
• Transfer exploits to target hosts.
• Compile exploits on Linux.
• Cross compile Windows exploits on Linux.

After we’ve covered these subjects we will practice the exploitation techniques on a few services that are running on Metasploitable 2
