In the information gathering phase of a penetration test you gather as much information as possible about the targets, networks and the connected hosts. In general, more information means a better understanding of the systems and a wider attack surface which, in turn, leads to better vulnerability assessments and better penetration testing results. 
Passive information gathering or OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) focuses on gathering information from publicly available sources, such as search engines, WHOIS databases, company websites and social media accounts, while active information gathering techniques involve a direct connection to and contact with the target to collect information about it. Examples of active information gathering techniques include ports scans, banner grabbing, protocol enumeration (SMB/SNMP/FTP/HTTP etc.) and vulnerability scans.
