-- auth.log --

sudo nano /var/log/auth.log


-- kern.log --

cat /var/log/kern.log
sudo dmesg


-- Clear Your Tracks with Shred --

But why don’t we just simply delete all those files, because all the deleted files can be recovered, and deleting them with shred it actually wipes them permanently
Shred actually renames the file, and changes it to 0’s so many times, and at the end removes it completely.

shred -h
man shred

shred -zxuvf (Name of your file)

-z, --zero     add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
-x, --exact    do not round file sizes up to the next full block; this is the default for non-regular files
-u             deallocate and remove file after overwriting
-v, --verbose  show progress
-n, --iterations=N  overwrite N times instead of the default (3)


-- Delete The History and Clear Your Tracks --

cat ~/.bash_history
> ~/.bash_history


-- Command history --

echo $HISTFILE
export HISTSIZE=0


-- Automate the Cleaning of (any) Files --

sudo crontab -e
00 23 * * * shed~/dev/null > ~/.bash_history && cat /dev/null > .bash_hystory


-- Secure-Delete --

Secure-Delete is a set of tools for Linux operating system and they provide advanced techniques for permanent removal of files.

sudo apt install secure-delete

⇒ srm, smem, sfill, sswap

srm --help
smem --help
sfill --help
sswap --help

-- Install Wipe --

Wipe was originally developed to securely erase files from magnetic media. Wipe repeatedly overwrites special patterns to the files to be destroyed, using the fsync() call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access. In normal mode, 34 patterns are used (of which 8 are random)

sudo apt install wipe

man wipe
wipe -h

sudo wipe filename
sudo wipe -r directory name


-- Some other Tricks --

➜ Check for hidden files: ls -altr
➜ Check what are the currently open files on the system: sudo lsof | grep .log
➜ Check what are the recent documents on the system: sudo find / -cmin 0 -print


-- Don't forgot to remove the Browser History --

Obviously, you should also think about your browser history, your cookies and so many other things.


-- Linux distribution Tails --

A good option is to use a Tails for example, which you install on a USB. After shutting down or restarting the system, all downloaded files, browser history, etc. - are deleted.
