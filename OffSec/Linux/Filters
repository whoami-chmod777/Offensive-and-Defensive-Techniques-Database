--- Filters ---

Filters are programs that take plain text (stored in a file or produced by another program) as standard input, transform it into a meaningful format, and then return it as standard output. Linux has a multitude of filters.

• cat
• head
• tail
• sort
• uniq
• grep
• wc
• sed
• awk
 
 
 -- Cat --

cat: display the contents of one or more text files on the terminal. 

cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config


-- Head --

head: display the first few lines of a specified file

head /var/log/apache2/access.log
head -n 3 /var/log/apache2/access.log


-- Tail --

tail: display the last few lines of a specified file

tail /var/log/auth.log
tail -n 3 /var/log/auth.log


-- Sort --

sort: sorts the contents of a given file alphabetically
 
sort names.txt


-- Uniq --

uniq: filters out consecutive duplicate lines from a file and shows the unique lines.

sort names.txt | uniq


-- Grep --

searches files for specific text strings, filters lines, and displays matching results
grep is a powerful tool commonly used to search log files, configuration files, or any text file.

grep '192.168.1.1' /var/log/apache2/access.log


-- Wc --

wc: determines how large a file is or how much data it contains

wc /etc/passwd
wc -l /var/log/apache2/access.log


root@hackerbox:~$ wc /etc/passwd
46   67 2544 /etc/passwd

46	             Number of lines
67	             Number of words
2544	           Number of characters
/etc/passwd      File path

-l: Displays only the number of lines.
-w: Displays only the number of words. 
-c: Displays only the number of bytes.
-m: Displays only the number of characters (useful for multi-byte character sets).


-- Sed --

Sed performing various text edits such as processing, modifying, adding, deleting, or replacing texts between files.

sed 's/Alice/George/' names.txt

root@hackerbox:~$ cat names.txt
Alice
Charlie
Bob

root@hackerbox:~$ sed 's/Alice/George/' names.txt
George
Charlie
Bob


-- Awnk --

awk reads files line by line, splits each line into fields (columns), and processes them based on specified conditions

oot@hackerbox:~$ cat names.txt
John Doe
Emily Clark
Alex Turner

root@hackerbox:~$ awk '{print $1}' names.txt
John
Emily
Alex

The command awk '{print $1}' names.txt processes the content of this file using the awk program. awk reads the text files line by line, splitting each line into fields separated by spaces or tabs.
