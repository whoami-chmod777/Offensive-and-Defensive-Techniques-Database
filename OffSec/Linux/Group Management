In Linux systems, a group is a collection of users who have specific permissions and access rights. Groups are used to simplify access control in file systems and make user management more efficient.

view the groups: cat /etc/group , cat /etc/group | grep development

Adding Users to a Group: sudo usermod -aG development john
