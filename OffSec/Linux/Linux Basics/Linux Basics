The Linux Operating System forms the basis of a huge number of the applications that we use every day on the internet. 
Linux servers are configured for uses as varied as high-performance computing, storage, network routing, and web servers. 
This flexibility has meant that the management of a Linux server is a complex subject with plenty of room for error. 
A large number of deployments and configurations has also led to new vulnerabilities being discovered almost every day. 
To protect a deployment on Linux, a system administrator must ensure that the Linux servers are always up to date with the latest security patches; a single vulnerable service or a minor mistake in configuration could leave the server, and the data residing on it, vulnerable to attack. 

As a pentester, it is important to know how to scout for vulnerabilities and the ways they can be exploited.

The objective of the Linux Basics section is to familiarize students with the Linux concepts and commands/tools required to interact with various services and applications.

What will you learn?

- Understanding the Linux filesystem and users
- Understanding the system and user crontabs
- Learning the important Linux commands and tools
- Fingerprinting web applications and network services such as FTP and SSH
- Creating bi-directional connections with socat
