-- Introduction to Linux Shells --

As regular users of operating systems, we all extensively use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to carry out most operations. It takes a few clicks on different options, and your task is done. 
However, you can perform almost every task by writing commands in the CLI of your operating system rather than using the GUI. The shells give you some great features for the commands you write in your CLI. 
This way of interacting with the OS is more efficient and resource-friendly.

Suppose you are in a restaurant and have two options for your food. The first option is to order food from the menu, and the waiter will serve it. The second option is to cook your desired dish yourself in the kitchen. 
In terms of a Linux system, the kitchen here is the OS, and using the GUI of the OS is just like ordering the food from the menu, and the waiter will serve it for you. 
However, using the CLI means you would have to go to the kitchen (OS) and cook your desired food. In this example, Shell would help you cook your desired dish by giving you some recipe suggestions. 
Using CLI to perform operations in a Linux system gives you more power and control while carrying out the tasks.

You may have seen hacking scenes in movies that show cool terminals with many commands getting executed. 
This is because most Linux users prefer to perform operations by writing commands on the CLI using shells instead of using the GUI. 


-- How To Interact With a Shell? --

Most Linux distributions use Bash (Bourne Again Shell) as their default shell. However, the default shell displayed when you open the terminal depends on your Linux distribution.

When interacting with a shell, you must be in the directory where you want to perform operations. By default, when you open a shell in most of the Linux distributions, you will be in your home directory. 
To see your current working directory, you can execute pwd, which stands for Print Working Directory.

However, you can change your directory as well. To do that, you can use cd (short for Change Directory).

While using the shell, to see the contents of a directory, you must enter the ls command. 

If you want to read the contents of a file, you can type the cat <filename> command in your shell.

The grep command is a very popular command among Linux users. This powerful command can search for any word or pattern inside a file.

user@tryhackme:~$ pwd
user@tryhackme:~$ cd Desktop
user@tryhackme:~$ ls
user@tryhackme:~$ cat filename.txt
user@tryhackme:~$ grep THM dictionary.txt


-- Types of Linux Shells --

Linux has different types of shells available, each with its own features and characteristics.

Multiple shells are installed in different Linux distributions. To see which shell you are using, type the following command: echo $SHELL

You can also list down the available shells in your Linux OS. The file /etc/shells contains all the installed shells on a Linux system. 

To switch between these shells, you can type the shell name that is present on your OS, and it will open for you: zsh

If you want to permanently change your default shell, you can use the command: chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh. This will make this shell as the default shell for your terminal.

user@tryhackme:~$ echo $SHELL
user@tryhackme:~$ cat /etc/shells
user@tryhackme:~$ zsh
user@tryhackme:~$ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh


-- Shell Scripting and Components --

• Variables
• Loops
• Conditional Statements
• Comments


A shell script is nothing but a set of commands. Suppose a repetitive task requires you to enter multiple commands using a shell. 
Instead of entering them one after one on every repetition of that task, which may take more of your time, you can combine them into a script. 
To execute all those commands, you will only execute the script, and all the commands will be executed. 

The first step is to open the terminal and select a shell. Let’s go with the bash shell, the default, and widely used shell in most distributions.

Unlike the other commands we type in the shell, we first need to create a file using any text editor for the script. The file must be named with an extension .sh, the default extension for bash scripts. 
The following terminal shows the script file creation: nano first_script.sh

Every script should start from shebang. Shebang is a combination of some characters that are added at the beginning of a script, starting with #! followed by the name of the interpreter to use while executing the script. 
As we are writing our script in bash, let’s define it as the interpreter in the shebang: #!/bin/bash

➜ Variables

A variable stores a value inside it. Suppose you need to use some complex values, like a URL, a file path, etc., several times in your script. 
Instead of memorizing and writing them repeatedly, you can store them in a variable and use the variable name wherever you need it.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey, what’s your name?"
read name
echo "Welcome, $name"

To execute the script, we first need to make sure that the script has execution permissions. To give these permissions to the script, we can type the following command in our terminal: chmod +x first_script.sh

Now that the script has execution permissions use ./ before the script name to execute it. 
We use ./ before the script to run rather than typing the script name directly because ./ tells the shell to execute the file that is present in the current directory.
If you don't define ./ before the script name, the shell will search the script in the PATH environment variable (that contains all the directories except the current one), and it will not find the defined script in any of those directories and generate an error

➜ Loops

Loop, as the name suggests, is something that is repeating. For example, you have a list of many friends, and you want to send them the same message. 
Instead of sending them individually, you can make a loop in your script, give your friend list to the loop and the message, and it will send that message to all your friends.

Let’s write a loop that will display all numbers starting from 1 to 10 on the screen. 

#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10};
do
echo $i
done

➜ Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are an essential part of scripting. They help you execute a specific code only when a condition is satisfied; otherwise, you can execute another code. 
Suppose you want to make a script that shows the user a secret. However, you want it to be shown to only some users, only to the high-authority user. 
You will create a conditional statement that will first ask the user their name, and if that name matches the high authority user’s name, it will display the secret. 

#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name first:"
read name
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then
        echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi

➜ Comments

Sometimes, the code can be very lengthy. In this scenario, the code might confuse you when you look at it after some time or share it with somebody. 
An easy way to resolve this problem is to use comments in different parts of the code. A comment is a sentence that we write in our code just for the sake of our understanding. 
It is written with a # sign followed by a space and the sentence you need to write.

#!/bin/bash

# Asking the user to enter a value.
echo "Please enter your name first:"

# Storing the user input value in a variable.
read name

# Checking if the name the user entered is equal to our required name.
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then

# If it equals the required name, the following line will be displayed.
echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"

# Defining the sentence to be displayed if the condition fails.
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi


user@tryhackme:~$ chmod +x first_script.sh

user@tryhackme:~$ nano first_script.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey, what’s your name?"
read name
echo "Welcome, $name"


user@tryhackme:~$ nano loop_script.sh

#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10};
do
echo $i
done


user@tryhackme:~$ nano conditional_script.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name first:"
read name
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then
        echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi


#!/bin/bash

# Asking the user to enter a value.
echo "Please enter your name first:"

# Storing the user input value in a variable.
read name

# Checking if the name the user entered is equal to our required name.
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then

# If it equals the required name, the following line will be displayed.
echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"

# Defining the sentence to be displayed if the condition fails.
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi


-- The Locker Script --

➜ Requirement

A user has a locker in a bank. To secure the locker, we have to have a script in place that verifies the user before opening it. When executed, the script should ask the user for their name, company name, and PIN. If the user enters the following details, they should be allowed to enter, or else they should be denied access.

• Username: John
• Company name: Tryhackme
• PIN: 7385


# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash 

# Defining the variables
username=""
companyname=""
pin=""

# Defining the loop
for i in {1..3}; do
# Defining the conditional statements
        if [ "$i" -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "Enter your Username:"
                read username
        elif [ "$i" -eq 2 ]; then
                echo "Enter your Company name:"
                read companyname
        else
                echo "Enter your PIN:"
                read pin
        fi
done

# Checking if the user entered the correct details
if [ "$username" = "John" ] && [ "$companyname" = "Tryhackme" ] && [ "$pin" = "7385" ]; then
        echo "Authentication Successful. You can now access your locker, John."
else
        echo "Authentication Denied!!"
fi


-- Practical Exercise --

• Flag: thm-flag01-script
• Directory: /var/log

#!/bin/bash

# Defining the directory to search our flag
directory=" "

# Defining the flag to search
flag=" "

echo "Flag search in directory: $directory in progress..."

# Defining for loop to iterate over all the files with .log extension in the defined directory
for file in " "/*.log; do
    # Check if the file contains the flag
    if grep -q "$flag" "$file"; then
        # Print the filename
        echo "Flag found in: $(basename "$file")"
    fi
done


➜ Solution

#!/bin/bash

# Defining the directory to search our flag
directory="/var/log"

# Defining the flag to search
flag="thm-flag01-script"

echo "Flag search in directory: $directory in progress..."

for file in "$directory"/*.log; do
    # Check if the file contains the flag
    if grep -q "$flag" "$file"; then
        # Print the filename
        echo "Flag found in: $(basename "$file")"
    fi
done
