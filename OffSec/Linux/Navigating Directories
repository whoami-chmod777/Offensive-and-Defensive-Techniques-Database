-- Navigating Directories --

The Linux file system is hierarchically organized, starting with the root directory /. Understanding this structure is key to effectively navigating in Linux.

• /: The root directory, the base of the file system.
• /bin, /sbin: Contains essential user and system binaries.
• /etc: Contains system configuration files.
• /home: Contains personal directories for users.
• /var: Contains variable files like logs and databases.
• /usr: Secondary hierarchy for user data; contains most user programs and utilities.

• pwd: show you your current location in the file system.
• ls: list the files and folders in your current directory.
• ls -l: shows details such as permissions, ownership, and modification times.
• ls -a: include hidden files
• ls -la: ls -la

• cd - : go back to the previous directory
