Auxiliary Module 
The Metasploit Framework includes hundreds of auxiliary modules that perform scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and much more. Although these modules will not give you a shell, they are extremely valuable when conducting a penetration test.

Auxiliary modules perform useful tasks such as:
• Administration: Making changes, operating, or manipulating the target machine.
• Analysis: Conducting analysis tasks such as password cracking.
• Data Collection: Collecting, compiling, or organizing data from a single target.
• Denial of Service: Crashing or slowing down a target machine or service.
• Scanning: Scanning targets for known vulnerabilities.
• Server Support: Running servers for common protocols such as SMB, FTP.
