--- Encoders ---

Encoders take the raw data of a payload and rearrange it using a specific encoding algorithm. This process masks characters that could cause issues on the target system or prevent the payload from working properly, commonly referred to as "bad characters."
For instance, characters like null byte (\x00) in many systems signify the end of a string. If such characters are present in a payload, the system may not handle the payload correctly. Encoders help avoid such issues.


Why Use Encoders

• Masking Bad Characters: Bad characters can cause the payload to not work as expected on the target system. Encoders mask these characters to ensure the payload runs smoothly.
• Bypassing Security Products: Antivirus software and other security products look for known malware signatures. Encoders make it harder for these security measures to detect the payload, increasing the chance of a successful attack.
• Providing Flexibility: Different encoders can be customized for various situations and target systems. This allows the attacker to choose the most suitable encoding method based on their needs.
