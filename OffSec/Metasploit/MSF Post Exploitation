-- Overview --

Post exploitation modules are used after a machine has been compromised and a meterpreter session has been opened. They perform various tasks such as collecting data from the machine and elevating privileges.
After penetrating a system, you may want to gain further access to the target's internal networks by pivoting and cleaning up your tracks as you move between systems. A penetration tester might want to sniff packets for other potential targets, modify registry entries to gain more information or access, or place a backdoor to ensure persistent system access.
Note: Post exploitation modules require an already opened Metasploit session.
