-- Overview --

After working so hard to successfully exploit a system, what do we do next?
We will want to gain further access to the targets internal networks by pivoting and covering our tracks as we progress from system to system. A pentester may also opt to sniff packets for other potential victims, edit their registries to gain further information or access, or set up a backdoor to maintain more permanent system access.
Utilizing these techniques will ensure that we maintain some level of access and can potentially lead to deeper footholds into the targets trusted infrastructure.
