-- DNS: Remembering Addresses --

Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for properly mapping a domain name to an IP address.

DNS operates at the Application Layer, i.e., Layer 7 of the ISO OSI model. DNS traffic uses UDP port 53 by default and TCP port 53 as a default fallback. 
There are many types of DNS records; however, in this task, we will focus on the following four

• A record: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set example.com to resolve to 172.17.2.172.
• AAAA Record: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting; neither falls under DNS.
• CNAME Record: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, www.example.com can be mapped to example.com or even to example.org.
• MX Record: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.

-- WHOIS --

You can look up the WHOIS records of any registered domain name using one of the online services or via the command-line tool whois, available on Linux systems, among others. 
As expected, a WHOIS record provides information about the entity that registered a domain name, including name, phone number, email, and address.
