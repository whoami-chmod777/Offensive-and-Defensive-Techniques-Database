-- Tips for OS Detection --

• Multiple Attempts: OS detection may not always be 100% accurate. Due to various network conditions or specific configurations on the target system, a definitive result may not be achieved on the first try. Performing multiple attempts can improve accuracy.
• Network Distance: Nmap can also estimate the network distance during OS detection. This information provides the "hop" count to the target system and can offer insights into the network topology.
• Combining with Other Nmap Features: Combining OS detection with other Nmap features such as service version detection (-sV) or network scanning (-sn) can allow for a more comprehensive network analysis.
• Verify Results: It is important to verify the obtained OS detection results through physical access or other methods if possible. This helps reduce false positives or negatives.
