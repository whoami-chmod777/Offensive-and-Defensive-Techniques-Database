-- Stages of Scans with Nmap --

When conducting an Nmap scan, the scanning process goes through a series of stages, starting from identifying targets to reporting the obtained information.

1. Target Identification: Begins working on the targets specified by the user.
2. Host Discovery: Various methods are used to detect active devices within the network.
3. Port Scanning: Identifies open ports and the services running on them.
4. Version Detection: Attempts to determine the versions of the services running on open ports.
5. OS Detection: Gathers information about the operating systems of the devices.
6. Traceroute: Determines the paths packets take to reach the target.
7. NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) Usage: Conducts various tests on targets using custom NSE scripts.
8. Reporting: The scan results are reported in various formats.
