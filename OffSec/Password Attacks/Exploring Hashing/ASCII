ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and other devices that use text. This system primarily includes printable characters such as letters of English alphabet (upper and lower case), numbers, and punctuation marks. Each ASCII character is assigned a unique number between 0 and 127.
