-- Privilege Escalation in Linux --

Our ultimate goal with privilege escalation in Linux is to gain a shell running as the root user.
Privilege escalation can be simple (e.g. a kernel exploit) or require a lot of reconnaissance on the compromised system.
In a lot of cases, privilege escalation may not simply rely on a single misconfiguration, but may require you to think, and combine multiple misconfigurations.
All privilege escalations are effectively examples of access control violations.
Access control and user permissions are intrinsically linked.


-- Understanding Permissions in Linux --

➜ Users, Groups, and Files & Directories

At a basic level, permissions in Linux are a relationship between users, groups, and files & directories.
Users can belong to multiple groups. Groups can have multiple users. 
Every file and directory defines its permissions in terms of a user, a group, and “others” (all other users).
