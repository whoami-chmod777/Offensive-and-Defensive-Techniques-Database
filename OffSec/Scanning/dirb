This repository provides a beginner's guide to using DIRB, an open-source web content and directory scanner primarily used in website footprinting for ethical hacking. DIRB works by using a pre-configured wordlist to perform dictionary attacks on a specified target web server, allowing it to discover hidden web objects such as files and directories. It is included by default in Kali Linux and is widely used in real-world penetration testing.

Key Features & Commands:

• Basic Scan: Simply run dirb to scan a website or web server.
• Ignore Warnings: Use the -w option to scan inside listable directories that are usually ignored.
• Case-Insensitive Search: The -i option allows you to perform case-insensitive searches.
• Save Output: The -o option saves the scan output to a file.
• Proxy Scan: Use the -p option to scan via a proxy server.
• Stop Recursive Searches: The -r option prevents recursive directory scanning.
• Interactive Recursion: The -R option allows for interactive recursion while scanning.
• Show Non-Existent Pages: The -v option shows both existing and non-existent pages or directories.
• Search Specific Extensions: The -X option lets you search for files with a particular extension, like .txt.
• Search Multiple Extensions: The -x option allows you to search for multiple file extensions from a list in a text file.


-- Dirb Options --

Basic Scan	
Perform a default scan on a specified target web server using the pre-configured wordlist.	
dirb <target_URL>

Ignore Warnings (-w)	
Scan inside directories even if they are listable, avoiding warnings about non-testable directories.	
dirb -w <target_URL>

Case-Insensitive Search (-i)	
Perform a case-insensitive search (default searches are case-sensitive).	
dirb -i <target_URL>

Save Output (-o)	
Save the scan output to a file for later review.	
dirb -o <output_file> <target_URL>

Scan Using a Proxy (-p)	
Perform the scan through a proxy to reduce noise and avoid detection on the target side.	
dirb -p <proxy_URL> <target_URL>

Stop Recursive Searches (-r)	
Prevent DIRB from scanning directories recursively.	
dirb -r <target_URL>

Interactive Recursion (-R)	
Enable interactive recursion to control the scanning process during directory traversal.	
dirb -R <target_URL>

Show Non-Existent Pages (-v)	
Show both existing and non-existent pages or directories on the target server.	
dirb -v <target_URL>

Search for Specific Extensions (-X)	
Search for files with a specific extension, e.g., text files (.txt).	
dirb -X .txt <target_URL>

Search Multiple Extensions (-x)	
Search for files with multiple extensions by specifying them in a text file, e.g., search extensions from ext_text file.	
dirb -x ext_text <target_URL>
