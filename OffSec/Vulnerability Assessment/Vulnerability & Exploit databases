• National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
• CVE Details


We will have a look at a few different vulnerability- and exploit databases that can be used to find known vulnerabilities and exploits. We will also have a look at how the severity of vulnerabilities is scored using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).


-- CVE Database --

 CVE stands for ‘Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures’ and the CVE database contains comprehensive information on all reported security vulnerabilities and exposures for a wide range of software and services.

-- National Vulnerability Database (NVD) --

The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics. The NVD scores vulnerabilities and performs analysis on CVEs that have been published.
The NVD also creates metrics and visualizations of the vulnerability data to get a high-level overview of the data, sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. 
Another nice feature of the NVD is that they have data feeds (XML/JSON) available with vulnerability information from the entire NVD database for anyone that has use for it. The feeds allow you to keep your resources that use vulnerability information up-to-date with the NVD data.
