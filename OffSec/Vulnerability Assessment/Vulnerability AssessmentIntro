A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, prioritizing and reporting vulnerabilities on a target system. In terms of information security, the primary purpose of conducting a vulnerability assessment is to find vulnerabilities in the system and to prioritize them so that effective remedial action can be taken.
Information-gathering techniques enumerate network hosts and services using various tools such as Nmap, Nikto and WPScan. The valuable information that was collected in that phase can now be used as input for the vulnerability assessment.

We will consider different ways of conducting a vulnerability assessment using:
• Different online and offline sources, such as vulnerability and exploit databases
• Scanning tools such as Nmap with scripts to test and verify vulnerabilities
• Automated vulnerability scanners such as OpenVAS
