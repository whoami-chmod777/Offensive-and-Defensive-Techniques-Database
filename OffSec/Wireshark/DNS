When troubleshooting DNS (Domain Name System) traffic in Wireshark, there are several common issues to look for, such as failed name resolutions, delayed responses, or unusual DNS traffic.

-- Key DNS Filters for Wireshark --

All DNS Traffic	
Shows all DNS queries and responses.
dns	

DNS Queries Only	
Filters only DNS query packets (from client to server)
dns.flags.response == 0	

DNS Responses Only	
Filters only DNS response packets (from server to client)
dns.flags.response == 1	

DNS Queries for a Specific Domain	
Shows DNS queries for a specific domain (e.g., google.com)
dns.qry.name == "<domain_name>"	

DNS Response Code (e.g., No Error)	
Filters DNS responses with a specific response code (e.g., 0 for "No Error")
dns.flags.rcode == 0	

DNS Response with Error	
Shows all DNS responses with an error (e.g., NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL)
dns.flags.rcode > 0	

DNS A Record Queries
Filters DNS queries requesting an A (IPv4) record	
dns.qry.type == 1	

DNS AAAA Record Queries (IPv6)	
Filters DNS queries requesting an AAAA (IPv6) record
dns.qry.type == 28	

DNS TXT Record Queries	
Filters DNS queries requesting a TXT record (commonly used in email verification, SPF)
dns.qry.type == 16	

DNS PTR Record Queries (Reverse DNS)	
Filters DNS queries for PTR records (reverse DNS lookup)
dns.qry.type == 12	

DNS MX Record Queries (Mail Exchange)	
Filters DNS queries for MX records (used for email delivery)
dns.qry.type == 15	

DNS Queries from a Specific IP	
Shows DNS queries originating from a specific IP address
ip.src == <ip_address> && dns.flags.response == 0	

DNS Responses from a Specific Server	
Filters DNS responses from a specific DNS server
ip.src == <dns_server_ip> && dns.flags.response == 1	


-- Analyzing DNS Performance --

Slow DNS Response Time	
Shows DNS responses that took longer than 1 second (indicates potential delay in name resolution)
dns.time > 1	

Retransmitted DNS Queries	
Displays DNS queries that were retransmitted due to no initial response
dns.flags.response == 0 && dns.retransmission	

Unusually Large DNS Responses	
Shows DNS packets larger than 512 bytes, which may indicate DNS over TCP or DNSSEC responses
dns && frame.len > 512	

DNS Queries with No Responses	
Displays DNS queries that did not receive a response (possible DNS server issue)
dns.flags.response == 0 && !dns.response_in	


-- Advanced DNS Filters --

DNS over TCP (instead of UDP)	
Filters for DNS traffic that is using TCP instead of the usual UDP (often for large DNS messages)
tcp.port == 53	

DNS over UDP	
Shows all DNS traffic over UDP (the default DNS transport protocol)
udp.port == 53	

DNSSEC Traffic	
Filters for DNSSEC traffic, which provides additional security for DNS responses
dns.flags.dnssec == 1	

Non-Standard DNS Ports	
Filters DNS traffic on non-standard ports (anything other than port 53)
dns && udp.port != 53	

Capture DNS Traffic for a Specific Protocol	
Filters DNS traffic for a specific IP protocol (such as TCP, UDP, etc.)
dns && ip.proto == <protocol_number>	


-- DNS Error Codes (Response Codes) --

Wireshark can help you analyze DNS issues by filtering for DNS response codes. These can include

No Error (0): Normal response
dns.flags.rcode == 0

Format Error (1): Malformed query 
dns.flags.rcode == 1

Server Failure (2): Server problem, can't process the query
dns.flags.rcode == 2

NXDOMAIN (3): Non-existent domain (name resolution failure).
dns.flags.rcode == 3

Not Implemented (4): Query type not supported by the server.
dns.flags.rcode == 4

Refused (5): Query refused by the DNS server (e.g., due to ACL or policy).
dns.flags.rcode == 5


-- DNS Packet Timing and Performance Analysis -

DNS Response Time: This shows how long it took for a DNS server to respond to a query. Slow DNS responses can result in noticeable delays in web browsing or other services relying on DNS

DNS Response Time
Shows DNS queries that took longer than 1 second
dns.time > 1


-- Miscellaneous DNS Filters --

Malicious DNS Activity	
Filters for DNS queries or responses related to known malicious domains
dns.qry.name contains "badsite"	

DNS Traffic with Specific TTL Value	
Filters DNS responses that contain a specific TTL value (useful for cache-related analysis)
dns.resp.ttl == <value>	

DNS Traffic with Specific Opcode	
Filters DNS traffic based on opcode (e.g., 0 for a standard query, 5 for a dynamic update)
dns.flags.opcode == <value>	


-- Common DNS Opcodes --

Standard Query (0): Standard DNS query for resolving names
dns.flags.opcode == 0

Inverse Query (1): Reverse lookups
dns.flags.opcode == 1

Status (2): Server status request
dns.flags.opcode == 2


-- Troubleshooting DNS with Wireshark --

Unresponsive DNS Server: 
dns.flags.response == 0 && !dns.response_in

Slow DNS Resolution: 
dns.time > 1

DNS Server Errors: 
dns.flags.rcode > 0

DNS Overload: High volume of DNS queries with retransmissions might indicate a DNS server overload or DoS attack
