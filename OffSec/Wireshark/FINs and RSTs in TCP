tcp.flags.fin == 1
tcp.flags.reset == 1

Purpose
FIN: Gracefully close a connection when both sides have finished data transmission.
RST: Abruptly terminate a connection due to an error, misconfiguration, or unexpected packet.

TCP Handshake
FIN: Requires a 4-way handshake (FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK) to close the connection.
RST: No handshake; the connection is instantly terminated.

Impact on Data Transfer
FIN: Allows both sides to ensure all data has been transmitted and acknowledged.
RST: Terminates the session immediately, causing possible data loss.

Normal Usage
FIN: Used during a 4-way termination process to cleanly close a connection.
RST: Used to immediately close a connection when something goes wrong (e.g., unexpected SYN packet, or application error).

Handshake Process
FIN: Initiates a 4-way termination with a sequence of FIN and ACK packets.
RST: Does not follow any handshake process; instantly terminates the connection.

Acknowledge Data?
FIN: Yes, FIN acknowledges all data received up to that point.
RST: No, RST is used to reject or terminate the connection, with no acknowledgment of data.

Acknowledge Required
FIN: Requires the receiver to respond with an ACK to confirm the connection closure.
RST: No acknowledgment is required; the connection is closed instantly.

Effect on Connection
FIN: After both sides exchange FIN packets and ACKs, the connection is fully closed.
RST: Immediately resets the connection, discarding all pending data and unacknowledged packets.

Example Scenario
FIN: Client and server both finish sending data and close the connection normally.
RST: A server receives a SYN packet on a port where no service is listening, resulting in an immediate RST.
