To use GeoIP features in Wireshark, you need to have the GeoLite2 database configured. Once it's set up, Wireshark can map IP addresses to countries, cities, or ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) using GeoIP data

Filters like ip.geoip.country_iso can be adjusted for IPv6 by using ipv6.geoip.country_iso if you're analyzing IPv6 traffic.
