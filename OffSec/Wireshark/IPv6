All IPv6 Traffic	
Shows all IPv6 traffic (regardless of protocol).	
ipv6

TCP over IPv6	
Displays all TCP packets over IPv6.	
tcp && ipv6

UDP over IPv6	
Displays all UDP packets over IPv6.	
udp && ipv6

ICMPv6 Traffic	
Shows all ICMPv6 messages (used for IPv6 error handling, discovery, etc.).	
icmpv6

IPv6 Fragmented Packets	
Shows fragmented IPv6 packets (can be used to identify evasion or fragmentation issues).	
ipv6.nxt == 44

IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation	
Detects Neighbor Solicitation messages (used for IPv6 host discovery).	
icmpv6.type == 135

IPv6 Neighbor Advertisement	
Detects Neighbor Advertisement messages (IPv6 equivalent of ARP reply).	
icmpv6.type == 136

IPv6 Router Solicitation	
Detects Router Solicitation messages (used for finding routers in IPv6 networks).	
icmpv6.type == 133

IPv6 Router Advertisement	
Detects Router Advertisement messages (used by routers to announce themselves).	
icmpv6.type == 134

ICMPv6 Echo Requests (Ping)	
Shows all IPv6 Ping requests (ICMPv6 echo requests, used for IPv6 host discovery).	
icmpv6.type == 128

ICMPv6 Echo Replies (Ping Response)	
Shows all IPv6 Ping replies (ICMPv6 echo replies, response to pings).	
icmpv6.type == 129

IPv6 Hop Limit Exceeded	
Shows ICMPv6 hop limit exceeded messages (similar to TTL exceeded in IPv4, useful for path discovery).	
icmpv6.type == 3 && icmpv6.code == 0

IPv6 Traffic with Hop-by-Hop Extension Headers	
Shows IPv6 packets with Hop-by-Hop extension headers (can indicate special handling or scanning).	
ipv6.nxt == 0

IPv6 Traffic with Destination Option Headers	
Detects packets with destination option extension headers.	
ipv6.nxt == 60

IPv6 Multicast Traffic	
Displays all traffic sent to IPv6 multicast addresses.	
ipv6.dst[0] == 0xFF

IPv6 Anycast Traffic	
Displays all traffic sent to an anycast address (common in load balancing).	
ipv6.dst == <anycast_address>

TCP SYN Scan over IPv6	
Detects SYN scans over IPv6 (similar to common Nmap scans).	
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0 && ipv6

DNS over IPv6	
Displays DNS queries over IPv6.	
dns && ipv6
