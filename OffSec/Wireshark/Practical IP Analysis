-- Digging Deeper into the IP ID --

Tracking Fragmented Packets: Use the same IP ID across fragments to track and ensure all fragments are received.
ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0

Detecting Packet Loss: Check for gaps in IP ID sequence. Missing or non-sequential IDs indicate packet loss.
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Identifying Out-of-Order Packets: Compare IP IDs in a flow; lower IDs arriving after higher ones suggest out-of-order packets.
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Verifying Path Consistency: Sudden changes in IP ID patterns or jumps may indicate packets taking different paths (e.g., load balancing).
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Detecting NAT or Firewall Changes: Compare IP IDs across different capture points. Changes in IP ID suggest NAT or firewall intervention.
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Analyzing MTU/Fragmentation Issues: Check that all fragments with the same IP ID are arriving. Missing fragments suggest MTU or fragmentation issues.
ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0 && ip.id == <id>

Tracking Retransmissions: Look for duplicate IP IDs to identify packet retransmissions within the same flow.
ip.id == <ip_id> && tcp.analysis.retransmission

Correlating Across Capture Points: Use the IP ID to track and correlate packets at different capture points in the network.
ip.id == <ip_id>


-- Using the TTL Field for Troubleshooting --

Detecting Routing Loops: Use ICMP Time Exceeded messages to identify loops; repeated TTL expiry is a key indicator.
Tracing the Path (Traceroute): Traceroute uses TTL to reveal the path of packets through the network, showing each hop along the way.
Detecting NAT or Firewalls: Compare TTL values before and after NAT/firewall; differences suggest TTL modification by these devices.
Multi-path Routing or Load Balancing: Varying TTL values in a single flow may indicate packets are taking different routes.
Checking Network Latency/Distance: Compare initial TTLs with observed TTLs to estimate the number of hops and diagnose latency or inefficiencies.
ICMP Error Messages: Use ICMP Time Exceeded messages to detect where TTL expires and track problem points.
Misconfigured Devices: Look for unexpected TTL behavior (e.g., not decrementing properly) to identify network device issues.
DNS Query TTL Debugging: Use TTL values in DNS queries to monitor the path and detect anomalies in routing.


-- IP Fragmentation --

IP Fragmentation occurs when a packet is too large to be transmitted over a network segment that has a smaller Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) than the packet size. To handle this, the original packet is broken into smaller fragments, each of which is sent separately and reassembled at the destination.

MTU: Maximum packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation.
IP ID: Unique identifier for reassembling fragments of the same packet.
Fragment Offset: Indicates where each fragment belongs in the original packet.
More Fragments (MF) Flag: Set for all fragments except the last one.
Fragmentation Troubleshooting: Use Wireshark filters to detect missing, fragmented, or excessive fragmentation issues.

Detect Fragmented Packets: ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0
Track a Specific Fragment by IP ID: ip.id == <ip_id> && (ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0)
Identify Missing Fragments: ip.id == <ip_id>
Find Last Fragment: ip.flags.mf == 0 && ip.frag_offset > 0
Check Fragment Reassembly Issues: ip.reassembled.in == 0
Track Fragmented Packets from a Host: ip.src == <source_ip> && (ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0)

MTU Mismatch: ping <destination> -f -l <packet_size>
Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) Issues: icmp.type == 3 && icmp.code == 4


-- IP Flags --

IP Flags are 3-bit fields in the IP header that control or indicate fragmentation of a packet, including Don't Fragment (DF) to prevent fragmentation, More Fragments (MF) to indicate more fragments follow, and one reserved bit.

The Don't Fragment (DF) flag in the IP header is crucial because it prevents the packet from being fragmented along its route. If a router encounters a packet larger than the network's Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and the DF flag is set, the router will drop the packet instead of fragmenting it and send back an ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" message to the sender. 

Filter for Packets with the DF Flag Set: ip.flags.df == 1
Filter for Packets without the DF Flag: ip.flags.df == 0
Filter for ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" Messages (indicating DF is set but packet exceeds MTU): icmp.type == 3 && icmp.code == 4
Filter for Fragmented Packets (without DF, and being fragmented): ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0
