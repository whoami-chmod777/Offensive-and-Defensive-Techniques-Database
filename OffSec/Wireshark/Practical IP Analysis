-- Digging Deeper into the IP ID --

Tracking Fragmented Packets: Use the same IP ID across fragments to track and ensure all fragments are received.
ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0

Detecting Packet Loss: Check for gaps in IP ID sequence. Missing or non-sequential IDs indicate packet loss.
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Identifying Out-of-Order Packets: Compare IP IDs in a flow; lower IDs arriving after higher ones suggest out-of-order packets.
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Verifying Path Consistency: Sudden changes in IP ID patterns or jumps may indicate packets taking different paths (e.g., load balancing).
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Detecting NAT or Firewall Changes: Compare IP IDs across different capture points. Changes in IP ID suggest NAT or firewall intervention.
ip.src == <source_ip> && ip.dst == <destination_ip>

Analyzing MTU/Fragmentation Issues: Check that all fragments with the same IP ID are arriving. Missing fragments suggest MTU or fragmentation issues.
ip.flags.mf == 1 or ip.frag_offset > 0 && ip.id == <id>

Tracking Retransmissions: Look for duplicate IP IDs to identify packet retransmissions within the same flow.
ip.id == <ip_id> && tcp.analysis.retransmission

Correlating Across Capture Points: Use the IP ID to track and correlate packets at different capture points in the network.
ip.id == <ip_id>


-- Using the TTL Field for Troubleshooting --

Detecting Routing Loops: Use ICMP Time Exceeded messages to identify loops; repeated TTL expiry is a key indicator.
Tracing the Path (Traceroute): Traceroute uses TTL to reveal the path of packets through the network, showing each hop along the way.
Detecting NAT or Firewalls: Compare TTL values before and after NAT/firewall; differences suggest TTL modification by these devices.
Multi-path Routing or Load Balancing: Varying TTL values in a single flow may indicate packets are taking different routes.
Checking Network Latency/Distance: Compare initial TTLs with observed TTLs to estimate the number of hops and diagnose latency or inefficiencies.
ICMP Error Messages: Use ICMP Time Exceeded messages to detect where TTL expires and track problem points.
Misconfigured Devices: Look for unexpected TTL behavior (e.g., not decrementing properly) to identify network device issues.
DNS Query TTL Debugging: Use TTL values in DNS queries to monitor the path and detect anomalies in routing.
