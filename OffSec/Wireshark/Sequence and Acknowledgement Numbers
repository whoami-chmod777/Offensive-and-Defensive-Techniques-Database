-- How Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers Work in TCP --

Sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers are essential for tracking data transmission in a TCP connection to ensure reliable delivery of data.

Sequence Number:
- The sequence number indicates the position of the first byte of data in the current TCP segment.
- The initial sequence number (ISN) is chosen randomly when the connection is established.
- As data is transmitted, the sequence number increases by the number of bytes sent in each segment.

 Acknowledgment Number:
- The acknowledgment number indicates the next expected byte from the other side, confirming that all previous data has been received.
- It acknowledges receipt by indicating the next sequence number the receiver expects.


Example of Sequence and Acknowledgment Flow:

1. Client sends data:
- Client sends a segment with sequence number = 1000.
- The segment contains 500 bytes of data.

2. Server acknowledges:
- Server receives the data and responds with an acknowledgment number = 1500, indicating it has received all bytes up to 1499 and is expecting the next byte to be 1500.

3. Next data transmission:
- Client sends more data with sequence number = 1500, based on the server's acknowledgment.


-- Summary of TCP Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers --

Sequence Number: 
Indicates the byte position of the first data byte in the segment being transmitted.

Acknowledgment Number:
Confirms receipt of data by indicating the next expected byte from the other side.
