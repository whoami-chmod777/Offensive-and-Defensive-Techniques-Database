-- Troubleshooting VoIP and Video Streams --

Troubleshooting VoIP (Voice over IP) and Video Streams can be complex, as it involves real-time communication protocols such as SIP, RTP, and RTCP, along with network factors like latency, packet loss, jitter, and QoS (Quality of Service). Below are some key areas and Wireshark filters to help troubleshoot VoIP and video streaming issues:

1. Key Protocols in VoIP and Video Streaming

- SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): Manages signaling and session control for VoIP calls (setup, management, teardown).
- RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol): Handles the actual media (audio/video) transmission in real time.
- RTCP (RTP Control Protocol): Monitors the quality of the RTP stream and provides feedback about the transmission.

2. Common Issues in VoIP/Video Streaming

- Latency: Delayed packets affect the real-time aspect of communication, causing voice or video delays.
- Packet Loss: Dropped packets can lead to poor audio or video quality (choppy calls).
- Jitter: Inconsistent packet arrival times lead to jitter, which causes voice or video stuttering.
- QoS (Quality of Service): Insufficient prioritization of voice or video traffic leads to degradation during periods of high network usage.

3. Wireshark Filters for VoIP and Video Troubleshooting

- SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Filters -


All SIP Traffic	
Shows all SIP signaling traffic (used for call setup, teardown, and management).
sip	

SIP INVITE Messages	
Filters for INVITE messages (used to initiate a VoIP call).
sip.Method == "INVITE"	

SIP Response Codes (e.g., 200 OK)	
Filters for SIP response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden) to track call status.
sip.Status-Code == 200	

SIP Call from Specific IP
Shows all SIP traffic originating from a specific IP address.	
ip.src == <source_ip> && sip	

SIP Call to Specific IP	
Shows all SIP traffic destined for a specific IP address.
ip.dst == <destination_ip> && sip	

SIP User/Caller	
Filters for SIP traffic from a specific user (based on the From field in the SIP headers).
sip.From contains "<username>"	


- RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) Filters -

All RTP Traffic	
Filters for all RTP packets carrying audio or video media streams.
rtp	

RTP Traffic from Specific IP	
Shows all RTP traffic from a specific source IP address (for tracking media).
ip.src == <source_ip> && rtp	

RTP Traffic to Specific IP	
Shows all RTP traffic destined for a specific IP address.
ip.dst == <destination_ip> && rtp	

RTP Stream Analysis	
Wireshark’s RTP Stream analysis tool helps assess jitter, delay, and other key metrics.
Use Telephony > RTP > RTP Streams	

RTP Packet Loss	
Analyze packet loss in RTP streams (look at lost packets and sequence numbers).
Use Telephony > RTP > Stream Analysis	

RTP Jitter and Latency	
Jitter and latency statistics can be viewed under the RTP stream analysis section.
Use Telephony > RTP > Stream Analysis	


- RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) Filters -

All RTCP Traffic	
Filters for RTCP packets (provides feedback on the quality of RTP streams).
rtcp	

RTCP Sender Reports
Filters for RTCP Sender Reports, which provide transmission statistics like packet count and bytes.
rtcp.pt == 200	

RTCP Receiver Reports	
Filters for RTCP Receiver Reports, which provide feedback about packet loss, jitter, and delay.
rtcp.pt == 201	

RTCP Traffic from Specific IP	
Shows RTCP traffic from a specific source IP (used to monitor media quality from that source).
ip.src == <source_ip> && rtcp	


4. Analyzing Jitter, Latency, and Packet Loss

Jitter: Variation in the arrival times of packets.
- Use RTP Stream Analysis to assess jitter.
- Look for values exceeding 20-30 ms, which may affect call quality.

Latency: The delay between packet transmission and reception.
- Look at the delta time between packets. Latency beyond 150-200 ms may cause noticeable delays in VoIP.

Packet Loss: Dropped packets can degrade audio or video quality.
- Use RTP Stream Analysis to view packet loss (missing sequence numbers or statistics in RTCP reports).


5. Quality of Service (QoS) Filters 

Filter for DSCP Values	
Filters for packets with specific DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) values to monitor QoS policies.
ip.dsfield == <dscp_value>	

VoIP Traffic with EF (Expedited Forwarding)	
Shows VoIP traffic marked for high-priority (Expedited Forwarding) treatment in QoS.
ip.dsfield == 0x2e	

Video Traffic with AF Class (Assured Forwarding)

7. Tools in Wireshark for VoIP Analysis

Telephony > VoIP Calls: This tool allows you to view, analyze, and play back captured VoIP calls. It shows all SIP call sessions and allows you to drill into the details of each call.
Telephony > RTP > RTP Streams: This tool helps analyze RTP streams, showing jitter, packet loss, and stream quality.
Telephony > RTP > Stream Analysis: Use this to dig deeper into jitter, latency, and packet loss for each RTP stream.


Key Metrics for Troubleshooting VoIP and Video

Latency: < 150-200 ms -> Latency beyond this causes noticeable delays in real-time communication.
Jitter:	< 20-30 ms -> Higher jitter leads to stuttering or choppy audio/video.
Packet Loss: < 1% -> Even a small percentage of lost packets can cause degraded audio or video quality.
