Wireshark is a network packet analyzer tool with the possibility to customize the names resolution settings and to save them.

Name Resolution in Wireshark is a powerful tool that provides clarity and context to network traffic, making it critical for effective analysis, but it must be used with awareness of its potential performance and privacy implications.

The Name Resolution settings in Wireshark can be critical for the following reasons:

1. Easier Understanding of Network Traffic
Without Name Resolution:
- You see raw IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or port numbers (e.g., 80) in packet captures.
- This can make it difficult to understand which devices, services, or domains are involved in the communication.
With Name Resolution:
- IP addresses can be resolved to meaningful domain names (e.g., example.com), and port numbers can be resolved to service names (e.g., HTTP instead of 80).
- This makes it easier to interpret the traffic and identify potentially suspicious hosts or services.

2. Faster Threat Detection
Name resolution can help security analysts quickly recognize malicious domains, C2 servers, or known-bad IPs during analysis.
For example:
- Unresolved: 93.184.216.34 (What is this?)
- Resolved: `malicious.example.com` (Clearly suspicious)
  
This helps to correlate traffic with threat intelligence feeds.

3. Context for Forensic Analysis
When reviewing PCAPs for forensic analysis, name resolution provides a clearer understanding of the context, such as:
- Identifying specific services in use (e.g., DNS, HTTPS).
- Recognizing external communication with unusual or suspicious domains.

4. Efficient Workflow in SOCs
- Resolving IPs and ports directly in Wireshark saves time compared to manually looking up this information elsewhere.

Risks and Drawbacks of Name Resolution
- Performance Impact: Enabling live name resolution (like DNS queries during capture) can slow down analysis.
- Privacy Issues: Name resolution may send DNS queries for captured traffic, potentially exposing information to external servers.
- False Positives: DNS-based name resolution may map IPs to incorrect or outdated domain names.

When is it Critical
- When analyzing DNS-based attacks: Name resolution helps identify malicious domains or DNS tunneling activity.
- When analyzing unknown traffic: Resolving ports and services can help uncover unusual activity.
- During incident response: Quickly identifying hostile IPs or domains speeds up containment and mitigation.

Name Resolution in Wireshark is a powerful tool that provides clarity and context to network traffic. Itâ€™s critical for effective analysis but must be used with awareness of potential performance and privacy implications

Name Resolution translates raw addresses (like MAC, IP, or ports) into human-readable names, making it easier to understand network traffic. For example:
- MAC Address â†’ Vendor name
- Port Numbers â†’ Protocol names
- IP Addresses â†’ Hostnames

How to Customize Name Resolution Settings

MAC Address Resolution:
	- Go to Edit > Preferences from the main menu.
	- Select Name Resolution in the left tree view.
	- Check the box for Resolve MAC Addresses.
	- Click OK to save the changes.
	- ðŸŸ¢ Result: In the Packet Details pane, MAC addresses are translated into vendor names when possible.

Port Name Resolution:
	- Go to Edit > Preferences from the main menu.
	- Select Name Resolution in the left tree view.
	- Check the box for Resolve transport names.
	- Click OK to activate port resolution.
	- ðŸŸ¢ Result: In the Packet List and Details panes, port numbers are replaced with protocol names (e.g., 80 â†’ HTTP).

IP Address Resolution:
	- Go to Edit > Preferences from the main menu.
	- Select Name Resolution in the left tree view.
	- Check the box for Resolve network (IP) addresses.
	- Click OK to enable IP name resolution.
	- ðŸŸ¢ Result: IP addresses in the Packet List pane are translated into hostnames when possible.

Why Enable Name Resolution?
- Simplifies Analysis: Instead of raw numbers, you see recognizable names.
- Faster Troubleshooting: Quickly identify devices, services, and hosts in the network traffic.
- Enhanced Context: Understand the relationship between packets at a glance.

Why Enable Name Resolution?
Faster Threat Detection: Recognize malicious domains or C2 servers quickly.
- Unresolved: 93.184.216.34
- Resolved: malicious.example.com
Enhanced Forensic Analysis: Identify services in use (e.g., DNS, HTTPS) and track suspicious hosts.

Risks and Drawbacks
- Performance Impact: Enabling live name resolution (like DNS queries during capture) can slow down analysis.
- Privacy Issues: Name resolution may send DNS queries for captured traffic, potentially exposing information to external servers.
- False Positives: DNS-based name resolution may map IPs to incorrect or outdated domain names.

When is it Critical
- When analyzing DNS-based attacks: Name resolution helps identify malicious domains or DNS tunneling activity.
- When analyzing unknown traffic: Resolving ports and services can help uncover unusual activity.
- During incident response: Quickly identifying hostile IPs or domains speeds up containment and mitigation.
