Wireshark's Statistics
Wireshark’s Statistics Page is a treasure of detailed information to identify protocols, applications, and conversations in a network capture. This functionality provides findings for analyzing and troubleshooting network traffic.

The Protocol Hierarchy tool provides an view of which protocols dominate your network traffic, making it easier to spot unusual activity.
The Conversations window is necessary for understanding communication flows between devices, including identifying potential bottlenecks or suspicious activity.

🛠️ Protocol Hierarchy:By selecting Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy, I visualized a detailed tree of protocols, displaying:
- Packet count and total bytes for each protocol.
- A structured view of traffic distribution.

🛠️ Conversations:Accessing Statistics > Conversations revealed granular details about network conversations, including:
- IP addresses and ports involved.
- Packet and byte counts for each conversation, broken down into directions (A → B, B → A).
- Relative start times and durations of conversations.
- Bit rate calculations for each communication direction.
