Visualizing Network Traffic with Wireshark: Endpoints, Packet Lengths, and GeoLocation 🌐

Wireshark is a powerful tool for network analysis, it's provide endpoint maps and packet length statistics takes your troubleshooting and monitoring to the next level. 

• GeoLocation: Quickly identify the geographic origin and destination of traffic for anomaly detection or compliance checks.
• Packet Length Statistics: Analyze traffic efficiency, detect anomalies, and understand the nature of the traffic (e.g., small packets for control, large packets for data transfer).

1. Capture Network Traffic

Open a terminal window and run:

ping -4 example.com /n 50

For Windows, use the /n switch to specify the ping count.
For Linux, you can simply run the command without additional switches.


2. Enable GeoLocation in Wireshark

To visualize endpoint locations:

- Download the GeoIP2 or GeoLite2 City database from MaxMind.
- Extract the database contents to a folder on your PC and note the location.
- In Wireshark:
	- Go to Edit > Preferences > Name Resolution > MaxMind Database Paths.
	- Click the add button (+) to specify the database location.
	- Click OK, then restart Wireshark to enable GeoLocation.


3. View Endpoint Maps

- Open your saved capture file in Wireshark.
- Go to Statistics > Endpoints from the main menu.
- In the Endpoints dialog box, click Map > Open in browser.
- A browser window will open, displaying the locations of all endpoints on a map. Hover over the points to see related IP addresses.


4. Evaluate Packet Lengths

- From the main menu, select Statistics > Packet Lengths.
- The Packet Lengths dialog box will show:
	- Count of packets within predefined length ranges.
	- Statistics like average, minimum, and maximum for each range.
	- The rate (ms) and percentage of packets in each range over the total.
