-- Here‚Äôs a table explaining the Wireshark Statistics features and their functions --

‚úÖ Capture File Properties
‚Ä¢ Function: Displays metadata about the capture file (time, packet count, size, etc.).
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Helps analysts quickly assess the capture scope (e.g., duration of attack, size of traffic dump).

‚úÖ Resolved Addresses
‚Ä¢ Function: Shows a list of IP addresses resolved to domain names (if name resolution is enabled).
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Helps identify malicious or suspicious domains involved in traffic.

‚úÖ Protocol Hierarchy
‚Ä¢ Function: Displays a breakdown of all protocols found in the capture (e.g., TCP, DNS, HTTP).
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Quickly reveals unusual protocols (e.g., seeing IRC or FTP in a restricted environment).

‚úÖ Conversations
‚Ä¢ Function: Lists communication sessions between endpoints, with byte and packet counts and between IP/MAC endpoints.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Identifies top talkers, potential data exfiltration, or C2 communications and unauthorized or unusual communication patterns between devices.

‚úÖ Endpoints
‚Ä¢ Function: Shows all endpoints (IP, MAC, ports) and their stats.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Helps locate internal/external devices generating or receiving traffic. Track down compromised or unauthorized endpoints communicating on the network.

‚úÖ IO Graphs
Function: Visualizes network traffic over time (packet or byte rate).
SOC Use: Detects spikes that may indicate scanning, DoS or DDoS attacks, or data bursts and other network anomalies.

‚úÖ Flow Graph
‚Ä¢ Function: Sequence diagram of communication flows (packet by packet).
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Useful for dissecting malware behavior or seeing step-by-step attack execution, identify attack paths, lateral movement, and the progression of attacks.

‚úÖ Packet Lengths
‚Ä¢ Function: Shows distribution of packet sizes.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Anomalous packet sizes (e.g., too small or large) may indicate covert channels or malformed packets. Large packets might indicate file transfers (exfiltration), while small ones might suggest reconnaissance.

‚úÖ Service Response Time
‚Ä¢ Function: Measures how long servers take to respond to requests for specific services like DNS and HTTP..
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Identifies slowdowns possibly caused by DDoS or infrastructure abuse.

‚úÖ TCP Stream Graphs
‚Ä¢ Function: Graphs of TCP streams showing sequence numbers, RTT, throughput, etc.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Detects anomalies in TCP behavior like retransmissions, resets, or packet loss (often seen in attacks or malware traffic). Diagnose slow or abnormal performance, potentially caused by attacks affecting availability.

‚úÖ Following Streams (TCP/UDP/HTTP/etc.)
‚Ä¢ Function: Reconstructs a full session between two endpoints (e.g., HTTP conversation). Enables inspection of specific TCP, UDP, or HTTP streams.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Critical for viewing malware payloads, credentials, or command-and-control messages.

‚úÖ HTTP Statistics
‚Ä¢ Function: Summarizes HTTP requests and responses (hosts, URIs, methods).
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Detects suspicious URLs, beaconing behavior, known bad user-agents or abnormal HTTP traffic (e.g., excessive POST requests, large uploads, exfiltration).

‚úÖ DNS Statistics
‚Ä¢ Function: Summarizes DNS requests/responses, including errors and types.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Identifies DNS tunneling, domain generation algorithms (DGAs), or queries to suspicious domains.

‚úÖ Exporting Objects
‚Ä¢ Function: Allows export of files from HTTP, SMB, FTP streams (e.g., images, executables).
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Recover malware samples or leaked files from network traffic for analysis.

üîç Display Filter Example: frame.marked == 1
‚Ä¢ Function: Filters for only those packets you have manually marked during your analysis.
‚Ä¢ SOC Use: Helps focus only on "interesting" packets you've flagged ‚Äî often used when going through large captures to save and review relevant evidence (e.g., C2 traffic, suspicious downloads, data exfiltration).



-- Wireshark Statistics for SOC Analysis --

‚Ä¢ Protocol Hierarchy find unusual traffic types.
‚Ä¢ Conversations identify high-traffic or rare communications.
‚Ä¢ IO Graphs	spot traffic anomalies and burst patterns.
‚Ä¢ DNS/HTTP Stats reveal C2 and malware communications.
‚Ä¢ Flow Graphs	visualize attacker steps or malware flow.
‚Ä¢ frame.marked == 1	focus on evidence during investigation.

‚Ä¢ Resolved Addresses quickly identify if an IP address maps to a well-known domain or a suspicious domain, helping to determine if a connection is benign or malicious.
‚Ä¢ Endpoints allow aquickly get an inventory of all devices involved in the traffic, helping spot unusual or unauthorized devices.
‚Ä¢ Following Streams enables in-depth review of a specific TCP, UDP, or HTTP conversation, providing context for potential command-and-control (C2) traffic or data exfiltration.
‚Ä¢ frame.marked == 1 is particularly useful in SOC environments where analysts collaborate to flag critical packets for review by others.
‚Ä¢ Exporting Objects lets analysts extract malicious payloads, making it easier to assess what kind of data is being transmitted and whether sensitive information is compromised.
