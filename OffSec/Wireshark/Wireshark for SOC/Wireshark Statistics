-- Here’s a table explaining the Wireshark Statistics features and their functions --


Summary
Provides an overview of the capture, including traffic volume and duration.
Quickly assess traffic behavior, spot abnormal traffic bursts or unexpected protocols.

Protocol Hierarchy
Shows the distribution of protocols used in the capture.
Identify unusual protocols that may indicate malicious activity (e.g., uncommon protocols used in lateral movement).

Conversations
Displays communication between IP/MAC endpoints.
Detect unauthorized or unusual communication patterns between devices.

Endpoints
Lists all the unique endpoints involved in the capture (IP, MAC, etc.).
Track down compromised or unauthorized endpoints communicating on the network.

Resolved Addresses
Maps IP addresses to domain names (if available).
Useful for identifying legitimate vs. suspicious domains communicating with internal assets.

IO Graphs
Visual representation of traffic over time.
Detect traffic spikes or drops indicative of DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, or other network anomalies.

Flow Graph
Visualizes the flow of communication between endpoints.
Identify attack paths, lateral movement, and the progression of attacks.

Packet Lengths
Shows the distribution of packet sizes in the capture.
Large packets might indicate file transfers (exfiltration), while small ones might suggest reconnaissance.

Service Response Time
Measures response times for specific services like DNS and HTTP.
Identify slow response times that may indicate network performance degradation due to malicious activity.

TCP Stream Graphs
Visualizes TCP stream data, including round-trip time and throughput.
Diagnose slow or abnormal performance, potentially caused by attacks affecting availability.

Following Streams
Enables inspection of specific TCP, UDP, or HTTP streams.
Track specific communication streams for deep packet analysis, such as reviewing an entire connection or exchange.

HTTP Statistics
Provides detailed statistics on HTTP requests and responses.
Detect abnormal HTTP traffic (e.g., excessive POST requests, large uploads, exfiltration).

DNS Statistics
Displays details of DNS queries and responses.
Identify DNS tunneling or malicious domain resolution attempts.

Exporting Objects
Allows exporting files, images, or other content transferred via HTTP, SMB, or other protocols.
Recover malware samples, images, or files that were transferred during an attack.

frame.marked == 1
Filter for specifically marked packets in Wireshark.
Highlight and focus on key packets flagged during the investigation, ensuring important events are analyzed.



-- Wireshark Statistics for SOC Analysis --

• Resolved Addresses are useful for SOC analysts to quickly identify if an IP address maps to a well-known domain or a suspicious domain, helping to determine if a connection is benign or malicious.
• Endpoints allow analysts to quickly get an inventory of all devices involved in the traffic, helping spot unusual or unauthorized devices.
• Following Streams enables in-depth review of a specific TCP, UDP, or HTTP conversation, providing context for potential command-and-control (C2) traffic or data exfiltration.
• frame.marked == 1 is particularly useful in SOC environments where analysts collaborate to flag critical packets for review by others.
• Exporting Objects lets analysts extract malicious payloads, making it easier to assess what kind of data is being transmitted and whether sensitive information is compromised.
